// Assertions the SHIPPED core stylesheet must satisfy — shared by the build
// (scripts/build-core-styles.mjs, which refuses to emit a bad file) and the
// standalone guard (scripts/check-core-css-compiled.mjs, which fails CI on one).
//
// The contract: dist/editor.css is fully compiled and namespaced. A raw
// `@tailwind` directive would be re-expanded by a HOST app's Tailwind against
// the host's config (collisions, wrong palette) and silently dropped in a host
// with no Tailwind at all (unstyled chrome). A selector that is not anchored to
// the editor reaches into host markup the editor does not own.
//
// STRUCTURAL, not a denylist. Naming the shapes we forbid only ever catches the
// leaks someone already thought of: `a { color }`, `:root { --doc-x }` and
// `.btn { padding }` all slipped past the four-pattern version of this check.
// The rule is inverted instead — every rule must be anchored — with a short,
// explicit allowlist for the engine's own namespaces.

 *
 * `.ProseMirror-` was here and is not ours at all — it is ProseMirror's, and
 * `.ProseMirror-yjs-cursor` is y-prosemirror's, so a host running its own
 * ProseMirror editor got our rules on its elements.
 *
 * `.layout-` and `.paged-editor` we do mint, but the names are generic enough
 * that a host could mint them too (`.layout-page-header`, `.layout-page-content`).
 * The old rationale — that they match painted document elements rather than
 * chrome, so the scope class "would be wrong" — does not hold: painted elements
 * are always inside the viewport, which always carries the scope class. They are
 * scoped now, which costs nothing and keeps the editor's CSS inside the editor.
