  // come from core — so this is the chrome, not the capability.
  'rulers',
  // The link popover is part of the provider/hooks layer, which landed React-first: it is
  // a context-backed hook plus a compound over it, and its Vue twin is the composable form
  // that lands with the rest of that layer. The ENGINE half is already shared — typed
  // links, sanitization, click classification, bookmark jumps, the ops, and Vue's
  // `text.link` enabled state all come from core — so this gap is the panel, not the
  // capability. Removed when the Vue provider/hooks twin lands.
  'hyperlinkPopup',
  // The navigation pane rides that same provider/hooks layer: a compound plus three
  // behavior hooks over the context-published editor, so its Vue twin is the composable
  // form. The ENGINE half is already shared — the search derivation, the session memo,
  // `findMatches`/`selectMatch` and the outline all live in core, and Vue reaches them
  // through the same facade — so this gap is the panel, not the capability. Removed when
  // the Vue provider/hooks twin lands.
  'navigation',
  // The menu bar rides that same provider/hooks layer. The ENGINE half is already shared
  // and MORE so than the pane's: `CHROME_MENUS` is the core registry both adapters read,
  // every actionable row is a `ChromeSlotId` whose enabled state comes from the same
  // `toolbarCommandState`, the two break commands are core rows, and the styles are in
  // the core stylesheet — so the Vue twin is markup over data it already has. `onOpen` is
  // that bar's File row handler and closes with it. Removed when the Vue provider/hooks
  // twin lands.
  'menu',
  'onOpen',
  // React renders viewport extras as children; Vue's equivalent is its default slot.
  'children',
  // The right-click menu rides that same provider/hooks layer, and its engine half is the
  // most shared of the four: `selectAll`, `copy`, `cut` and `paste` are core commands, the
  // rows ARE the menu bar's rows, every enabled state comes from the same `Editor.can`, the
  // styles are in the core stylesheet, and the surface's pointer controller already ignores
  // non-primary buttons so a right-click reaches a menu with the selection intact. The Vue
  // twin is a panel and a placement rule. Removed when the Vue provider/hooks twin lands.
  'contextMenu',
  // Where the display scale comes from: a fixed number, or a fit the engine keeps tracking.
  // This is the shallowest gap of the lot — the fit runs in the ENGINE, `'auto'` is
  // `createDocxEditor`'s default, and `getZoomMode`/`setZoomMode`/`snapshot().zoomMode` are
  // contract members Vue already reaches through the facade. A Vue host has fit-to-viewport
  // zoom today and can change the mode; what it cannot do is declare it as a prop. Removed
  // when the Vue prop surface catches up (the adapter change is a prop, a spread and a
  // watcher), and blocked on nothing but that: `docs/api/docx-editor-vue` is frozen while
  // the package is `disconnected`, so the parity contract cannot see a Vue prop added today.
