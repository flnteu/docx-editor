# Engine lane topology

The engine is ONE package, `@docx-editor.dev/core`, divided into guarded internal
lanes under `packages/core/src/`. This record covers the lane boundaries, their
responsibilities, and the rules CI enforces.

- Machine-readable source of truth: `packages/core/src/__tests__/core-lane-graph.ts`
- Enforcement (all under `bun test`):
  - `packages/core/src/__tests__/core-lane-graph.test.ts` — the DAG is acyclic,
    every lane resolves to real source, subpaths and directories are unique.
  - `packages/core/src/__tests__/browser-bundle-graph.test.ts` — walks the real
    import graph from the browser entry points, because a `package.json` rule is
    not what a bundler follows.
  - `packages/core/src/store/__tests__/prosemirror-isolation.test.ts` — PM-free
    lanes stay PM-free, by identifier and not just by import.
  - `bun run check:lane-boundaries` — compiles each runtime-neutral lane against
    its own DOM-free `tsconfig`.

## Why lanes and not packages

Eight `engine-*` workspace packages were collapsed into this one. npm enforced
those boundaries for free — a package cannot import what it does not depend on —
and that enforcement disappears the moment the code shares a directory tree. So
the same boundaries are re-declared as a rule over paths and checked in CI.

The DAG was kept identical to the package graph it replaced. A lane quietly
gaining a dependency during the move would have been a design change smuggled in
as a file move.

## Lanes

| Lane         | Directory        | Subpath        | May import                                            | Environment |
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `contracts`  | `src/contracts`  | `./contracts`  | —                                                     | neutral     |
| `store`      | `src/store`      | `./store`      | —                                                     | neutral     |
| `binding`    | `src/binding`    | `./binding`    | contracts, store                                      | browser     |
| `layout`     | `src/layout`     | `./layout`     | store                                                 | neutral     |
| `output`     | `src/output`     | `./output`     | store, layout                                         | browser     |
| `automation` | `src/automation` | `./automation` | store                                                 | neutral     |
| `editor`     | `src/editor`     | `./editor`     | contracts, store, binding, layout, output, automation | browser     |

Responsibilities:

- **`contracts`** — declaration-only public API: `Editor`, `EditorHost`,
  commands, queries, document types.
- **`store`** — the bounded OPC/OOXML trust boundary, the canonical ordered OOXML
  tree, `TreeDocumentStore`, and the `TreeDocOp` vocabulary. The source of truth.
- **`binding`** — the ONLY ProseMirror-aware lane: projects a tree revision into
  a PM doc, and maps an edited doc back into tree ops or refuses.
- **`layout`** — resolved caches, shaping, convergent pagination, positioned
  semantic layout records. Emits geometry, never paints.
- **`output`** — the painter over those records. Never rederives geometry or
  interprets CSS.
- **`automation`** — the transport-neutral host port an automation object model
  programs against (`@docx-editor.dev/editor-api`). Store and nothing else: a
  server has to be able to run it, so reaching into binding, output or editor
  would put a DOM in a headless host.
- **`editor`** — the browser composition root. Composes the tree session,
  pagination and the paginated surface into the `Editor`/`EditorHost` contract.

Edges point downward only. A lane that acquires a new dependency declares it in
`core-lane-graph.ts`, in a diff a reviewer sees.

## Guarantees

**ProseMirror is contained to `binding`.** `contracts`, `store`, `layout` and
`output` may not name a PM type or reach a PM view — enforced by identifier scan,
since a structurally-typed leak (a parameter shaped like an `EditorView`, a
re-exported PM alias) needs no import to exist. Nothing on a headless or
server path transitively pulls in ProseMirror.

**Runtime-neutral lanes are DOM-free.** `store`, `layout` and `automation` each
carry their own `tsconfig.json` with a DOM-free `lib`, so a `document` or
`window` reference fails to typecheck. The shared core config includes DOM for
the browser lanes, which is exactly why the per-lane projects have to exist —
without them, a DOM reference in the store lane would compile. `contracts` is
excluded on purpose: it is declaration-only and names `HTMLElement` for host
element accessors, a type reference rather than a runtime need.

**A browser bundle stays a browser bundle.** `yjs`, `y-protocols`, `pdfkit`,
`node:fs`, `node:net` and `node:http` must not reach a default browser import.
The bundle-graph test follows real `import` statements through re-export barrels
to prove it, because one `export *` is enough to put a transport stack in every
consumer's bundle while every manifest still looks correct.

## Guards must fail loudly

Every guard scans a lane by path and calls `collectSources` on the result.
`collectSources` on a missing directory returns an empty list, so a guard whose
lane moved passes having examined no files. That is not a hypothetical: the
collapse of the `engine-*` packages turned several guards into vacuous passes,
and the suite stayed green.

So every scanned path goes through `existingLanePath`, which throws when the path
does not resolve. When you move a lane, update its `directory` in
`core-lane-graph.ts` and the guards that name it — the throw tells you which.
