## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: An inline drawing occupies its extent in the line

An inline drawing SHALL occupy `wp:extent` in the line, participate in line breaking as an unbreakable item, and align on the text baseline as Word does. `@distL` and `@distR` SHALL apply as horizontal spacing.

#### Scenario: Inline image reserves space

- **WHEN** a paragraph contains an inline drawing of 381000×381000 EMU
- **THEN** the line reserves that width and height, and following text starts after it

#### Scenario: Image too wide for the remaining space

- **WHEN** an inline drawing does not fit in the space left on the line
- **THEN** it moves to the next line rather than overflowing the content box

#### Scenario: Image taller than the line

- **WHEN** an inline drawing is taller than its line's text
- **THEN** the line's height grows to contain it and following lines are pushed down

#### Scenario: Image wider than the content box

- **WHEN** an inline drawing's extent exceeds the available content width
- **THEN** it is laid out at the declared extent and the overflow behaviour is defined and consistent, not left to whichever clip happens to apply

#### Scenario: Distance insets apply

- **WHEN** a drawing declares `@distL` or `@distR`
- **THEN** that spacing separates it from adjacent inline content

### Requirement: An anchored drawing resolves against its declared frames

An anchored drawing SHALL resolve `wp:positionH` against its `ST_RelFromH` frame and `wp:positionV` against its `ST_RelFromV` frame, honouring both the `wp:align` and the `wp:posOffset` choice.

#### Scenario: Margin-relative right alignment

- **WHEN** an anchor declares `positionH relativeFrom="margin"` with `wp:align`=right, as the comprehensive fixture's floating image does
- **THEN** its right edge sits at the right margin

#### Scenario: Paragraph-relative vertical offset

- **WHEN** an anchor declares `positionV relativeFrom="paragraph"` with `wp:posOffset`=0
- **THEN** its top sits at the top of its anchoring paragraph

#### Scenario: Page-relative positioning is page-relative

- **WHEN** an anchor declares a page-relative frame
- **THEN** it is positioned against the page, not against the anchoring paragraph, on whichever page its anchor lands

#### Scenario: layoutInCell inside a table

- **WHEN** an anchor with `@layoutInCell="1"` is anchored inside a table cell
- **THEN** its frames resolve against the cell
- **AND** with `@layoutInCell="0"` they resolve against the page or margin as declared

#### Scenario: Unsupported frame falls back visibly

- **WHEN** a positioning frame is one layout does not resolve
- **THEN** the drawing is placed by a declared fallback and the fallback is reported as a layout reason, not applied silently

### Requirement: Wrap modes produce exclusion zones the text flows around

The wrap element SHALL determine how surrounding text flows. `wrapNone` produces no exclusion. `wrapSquare` excludes the drawing's bounding box plus its distance insets, on the side or sides `ST_WrapText` names. `wrapTight` and `wrapThrough` exclude their declared polygon. `wrapTopAndBottom` excludes the full content width for the drawing's vertical band.

#### Scenario: Square wrap on both sides

- **WHEN** a drawing declares `wrapSquare` with `ST_WrapText` of `bothSides`
- **THEN** text flows on both sides of its exclusion box

#### Scenario: Square wrap on one side

- **WHEN** `ST_WrapText` is `left` or `right`
- **THEN** text flows only on that side and the other side is left empty

#### Scenario: Distance insets widen the exclusion

- **WHEN** a wrapped drawing declares `@distL="114300"`
- **THEN** the exclusion zone is wider than the drawing by that inset

#### Scenario: Top and bottom wrap

- **WHEN** a drawing declares `wrapTopAndBottom`
- **THEN** no text sits beside it; the full content width is excluded for its vertical band

#### Scenario: wrapNone overlaps text

- **WHEN** a drawing declares `wrapNone`
- **THEN** text flows as if the drawing were absent and the drawing paints over or under it per `@behindDoc`

#### Scenario: Exclusion is a layout input, not a paint effect

- **WHEN** a wrapped drawing is present
- **THEN** line breaking accounts for the exclusion when measuring available width, so text is not painted under the drawing and then clipped

### Requirement: Paint order follows behindDoc and relativeHeight

`@behindDoc` SHALL place a drawing behind or in front of the text layer, and `@relativeHeight` SHALL order anchored drawings among themselves. `@allowOverlap` SHALL govern whether two anchored drawings may occupy the same space.

#### Scenario: Behind text

- **WHEN** a drawing declares `@behindDoc="1"`
- **THEN** it paints behind the text layer and the text is legible over it

#### Scenario: In front of text

- **WHEN** a drawing declares `@behindDoc="0"`, as the comprehensive fixture's floating image does
- **THEN** it paints in front of the text layer

#### Scenario: Two anchored drawings

- **WHEN** two anchored drawings would occupy the same space
- **THEN** the one with the greater `@relativeHeight` paints on top
- **AND** where `@allowOverlap="0"`, the later drawing is displaced instead of overlapping

#### Scenario: Paint order does not change layout

- **WHEN** paint order is resolved
- **THEN** no exclusion zone or line break changes as a result

### Requirement: An anchored object never sizes a header or footer box

A header or footer box SHALL be sized by its story's flow height. An anchored drawing's extent, position, or effect extent SHALL NOT enlarge it.

#### Scenario: Anchored letterhead in a header

- **WHEN** a header contains an anchored drawing positioned page-relative and extending well below the header's text
- **THEN** the header box is still sized by the story's flow height
- **AND** the body content area is not pushed down by the drawing's extent

#### Scenario: Drawing still paints

- **WHEN** such a drawing extends beyond the header box
- **THEN** it paints where its anchor places it, without the box growing to contain it

### Requirement: Drawings participate in semantic interaction

A drawing SHALL be selectable and hit-testable through semantic layout records, not through painted DOM geometry, and SHALL have a defined position in the caret space.

#### Scenario: Click selects the drawing

- **WHEN** a pointer event lands on a painted drawing
- **THEN** the hit test resolves to that drawing and selects it as a unit

#### Scenario: Caret steps over an inline drawing

- **WHEN** the caret moves across an inline drawing with an arrow key
- **THEN** it steps over it as one unit rather than landing inside it

#### Scenario: Anchored drawing is not in the text caret path

- **WHEN** the caret moves through the paragraph anchoring a floating drawing
- **THEN** it traverses only the text, and the drawing is reached by clicking or by an explicit selection command

#### Scenario: Selecting a range containing an inline drawing

- **WHEN** a selection spans text and an inline drawing
- **THEN** the drawing is included, and deleting the range removes the drawing with the text in one transaction

### Requirement: Unrenderable formats reserve space and say so

Any format the runtime cannot decode SHALL reserve its declared extent and paint a placeholder carrying the reason. Such an image SHALL NOT paint a broken-image indicator, collapse to zero size, or be omitted. TIFF, EMF and WMF SHALL be offered to the decode port's conversion hook first, and paint as ordinary images when it returns a raster; the placeholder is what a declined, failed, or absent conversion falls back to.

#### Scenario: EMF reserves its extent

- **WHEN** a document contains an EMF image
- **THEN** its declared extent is reserved so surrounding text lays out as it would in Word, and a placeholder is painted

#### Scenario: Placeholder does not claim support

- **WHEN** a placeholder is painted for an undecodable format
- **THEN** it names the format, so the state is diagnosable rather than looking like a rendering bug
