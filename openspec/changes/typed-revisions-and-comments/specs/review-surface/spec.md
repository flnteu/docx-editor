## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The surface presents the document's markup, and invents none

The review surface SHALL present what ECMA-376 Part 1 markup states — who proposed a change, over which characters, and of which kind — and SHALL NOT synthesize a decision the markup does not carry. Where the surface groups several elements into one card, the grouping SHALL be derived from their recorded identity or their anchors, never from the wording of their text.

#### Scenario: Nothing on a card comes from prose

- **WHEN** a revision or comment carries text that reads like a classification
- **THEN** the card's kind, author, date, and grouping still come from the markup alone

### Requirement: The declared review chrome slots become wired

`review.comments` and `review.editingMode` already exist in the chrome registry and are absent from the slot→command table, so they render disabled with "not wired to an editor command". Both SHALL be wired. The registry SHALL additionally gain `review.accept`, `review.reject`, `review.acceptAll`, `review.rejectAll`, and `review.displayMode`. `ChromeSlotId` is public API forever, so these ids SHALL NOT be renamed after they ship.

#### Scenario: Both adapters light up from one row

- **WHEN** `review.comments` is added to the slot→command table
- **THEN** the React and Vue default toolbars derive the control from `CHROME_GROUPS` with no hand-listing in either adapter

#### Scenario: Disabled reasons come from the engine

- **WHEN** `review.accept` is unavailable because the caret is not in a revision
- **THEN** the control renders disabled with the engine's own reason, never a string invented by the adapter

#### Scenario: Editing mode reflects live state

- **WHEN** suggesting mode is active
- **THEN** `review.editingMode` renders its current value as suggesting, not as a static label

#### Scenario: Display mode is a value slot

- **WHEN** the user selects a display mode
- **THEN** it changes what layout produces and applies no `TreeDocOp`

### Requirement: A review sidebar lists threads and revisions anchored to their positions

The adapter SHALL present comment threads and revisions in a sidebar, each anchored to the vertical position of its range, ordered by document position, and showing author, date, and content.

#### Scenario: Cards align to their anchors

- **WHEN** a document with four comments is displayed
- **THEN** each card sits at the vertical position of its anchored range and cards do not overlap

#### Scenario: Anchor positions come from layout records

- **WHEN** card positions are computed
- **THEN** they derive from semantic layout records, not from measuring painted DOM

#### Scenario: Selecting a card selects its range

- **WHEN** the user selects a comment card
- **THEN** the anchored range is highlighted and scrolled into view

### Requirement: The caret activates the review item it sits in

Placing the caret inside a commented range or a revision SHALL make that item the active one: its card opens, showing the thread and the reply affordance, and the anchored range is highlighted in the document. Activation SHALL be derived from the selection against layout ranges, so a caret arriving by click, by keyboard, or by navigation activates identically.

A host MAY instead name the item to open BY KEY. That key SHALL be the active item for as long as the selection the engine installed for it stays live, and a caret move SHALL hand the answer back to the selection. A key is required because a selection cannot always name one item: two changes can cover exactly the same characters, and no position distinguishes them.

#### Scenario: Caret in a commented range opens its thread

- **WHEN** the caret is placed inside a range covered by a comment
- **THEN** that comment's card becomes active, its replies are shown, and its reply affordance is ready for input without a further click
- **AND** the anchored range is highlighted in the document

#### Scenario: Caret in a revision opens its card

- **WHEN** the caret is placed inside a `w:ins` or `w:del`
- **THEN** that revision's card becomes active, showing author, date, and its accept and reject actions
- **AND** any comment anchored over the same range is shown with it

#### Scenario: The caret at a range boundary still activates

- **WHEN** the caret rests exactly at the end of a commented or revised range, with the range entirely before it
- **THEN** the item still activates, because both sides of the caret are considered

#### Scenario: Nested ranges activate the innermost

- **WHEN** the caret sits inside two overlapping comment ranges
- **THEN** the innermost range's card is the active one, and the containing item stays listed and reachable

#### Scenario: A range that only ends at the caret yields to one that contains it

- **WHEN** the caret sits where one change ends and another begins
- **THEN** the change the caret is inside is the active one, however much narrower the change ending there is
- **AND** a change with no characters at that exact offset — a tracked paragraph mark, a point comment — outranks both

#### Scenario: A deletion inside an insertion activates as the deletion

- **WHEN** the caret sits in text one reviewer inserted and another deleted, so `w:ins` wraps `w:del` and both cover the same characters
- **THEN** the deletion's card is the active one, because it is the change striking the words on the page and the one an accept under the caret performs
- **AND** the enclosing insertion stays listed, activatable by key, and separately resolvable

#### Scenario: Opening a card by key opens THAT card

- **WHEN** a host activates one of two changes covering the same characters by key
- **THEN** that change's card is the active one, not whichever change the installed selection would classify to
- **AND** the engine reports the open card once, not the other card followed by a correction

#### Scenario: Closing every card at one position leaves none open

- **WHEN** the reader closes the open card at a position several cards cover
- **THEN** the next card down opens, each card is offered at most once, and closing them all leaves no card open until the caret moves

#### Scenario: Activation is a view state, not an edit

- **WHEN** the caret moves in and out of review items
- **THEN** no `TreeDocOp` is applied and no `ModelChange` is published

#### Scenario: Leaving the item deactivates it

- **WHEN** the caret moves to a position covered by no comment and no revision
- **THEN** no card is active and no range is highlighted as active

#### Scenario: A resolved comment does not steal activation

- **WHEN** the caret enters a range whose only comment is resolved
- **THEN** that comment is not activated, so a resolved thread does not reopen itself as the user types

#### Scenario: Threads render as threads only when the file says so

- **WHEN** the document has no `commentsExtended.xml`, as the comprehensive fixture
- **THEN** all four comments render as independent top-level cards, and reply and resolve are offered as actions that will create the missing part rather than shown as broken

#### Scenario: Orphaned comments are listed

- **WHEN** a comment's anchor is orphaned
- **THEN** the sidebar lists it, marked orphaned, rather than dropping it

#### Scenario: Comments outside the body are attributed

- **WHEN** a comment is anchored in a header, footer, or note
- **THEN** its card states which story it belongs to

### Requirement: Accept and reject are reachable per revision, per selection, and for all

The surface SHALL offer accept and reject for the revision at the caret, for every revision in a selection, and for the whole document, plus navigation to the next and previous revision. A document-wide action SHALL be confirmed before it is applied.

#### Scenario: Accept the revision at the caret

- **WHEN** the caret is inside a revision and the user invokes `review.accept`
- **THEN** that revision is accepted and the surrounding text re-flows

#### Scenario: Accept over a selection

- **WHEN** a range spanning three revisions is selected and accept is invoked
- **THEN** all three are accepted in one transaction and one undo restores all three

#### Scenario: Accept all is confirmed

- **WHEN** the user invokes `review.acceptAll`
- **THEN** a confirmation is required before a document-wide, single-undo change is applied

#### Scenario: Move pairs accept together from the surface

- **WHEN** the user accepts one half of a move from the sidebar
- **THEN** both halves resolve, and the surface does not offer accepting a `moveTo` alone

#### Scenario: Navigation between revisions

- **WHEN** the user invokes next-change or previous-change
- **THEN** the caret moves to the next revision in document order, across stories, and the sidebar follows

### Requirement: Suggesting mode is visible and requires an author

Suggesting mode SHALL be visible without opening a menu, and the adapter SHALL obtain an author before enabling it, because the engine refuses to enable it without one.

#### Scenario: Mode is unmistakable

- **WHEN** suggesting mode is active
- **THEN** the editing-mode control shows it, and it is discoverable without opening a menu

#### Scenario: Author prompt before enabling

- **WHEN** the user enables suggesting mode with no author configured
- **THEN** the adapter obtains an author before enabling, because enabling without one is refused by the engine

#### Scenario: Typing is visibly tracked

- **WHEN** the user types in suggesting mode
- **THEN** the text appears with insertion presentation immediately, in the same repaint as the keystroke's commit

### Requirement: The review surface is localized and accessible

Every user-facing string on the review surface SHALL resolve through the i18n layer, and comment cards and revision indicators SHALL be reachable by keyboard and exposed to assistive technology.

#### Scenario: No hardcoded English

- **WHEN** cards, actions, mode labels, and confirmations render
- **THEN** every string resolves through the i18n layer and `bun run i18n:validate` passes

#### Scenario: Dates are localized

- **WHEN** a comment's date renders
- **THEN** it is formatted for the active locale rather than printed as a raw ISO string

#### Scenario: Cards are keyboard-reachable

- **WHEN** the user navigates without a pointer
- **THEN** comment cards and their reply, resolve, accept, and reject actions are reachable and invocable

#### Scenario: Sidebar mousedown does not steal the caret

- **WHEN** the user presses a sidebar control that is not an INPUT, SELECT, or TEXTAREA
- **THEN** the mousedown is prevented so the caret does not move

#### Scenario: Comment text is never built from a string into DOM

- **WHEN** a comment's author, initials, or body text is rendered
- **THEN** it is set as text content, never assigned as markup, because every value in a comment part is attacker-controlled
