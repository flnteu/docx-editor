// @docx-editor.dev/fonts/google — Google-hosted faces, fetched on demand.
//
// `defaultFonts()` ships five families in the bundle and loads them whichever document
// opens. `googleFonts()` inverts both halves: nothing is bundled, and nothing is fetched
// until a document turns out to name a family the catalog covers. Open a file that uses
// only Calibri and exactly one family is fetched; open one that uses none of the catalog
// and no request is made at all.
//
// It is a `FontResolver`, so the editor calls it once per load with the families the file
// declares. That is the part to be deliberate about: it makes OPENING A DOCUMENT perform
// network requests, which the engine will never do on its own. What keeps it safe is that
// a declared family is only ever a LOOKUP KEY:
//
//   - The catalog is generated, closed and pinned (`google-catalog.generated.ts`). A name
//     is either in it or it is not; nothing is interpolated into a URL, so a crafted
//     `w:rFonts` cannot point this at a host of its choosing.
//   - Every URL is pinned to one immutable google/fonts commit and carries a baked
//     `sha256:`. Bytes are trusted by CONTENT, and the engine's admission path re-derives
//     the hash, so a swapped CDN asset fails there with a typed `hashMismatch`.
//   - The editor caps the families it hands over (`MAX_RESOLVER_FAMILIES`), so a file
//     declaring thousands of faces cannot fan this out into thousands of fetches.
//
// What it does NOT protect against is the CDN learning which families a document uses.
// That is inherent to fetching them, which is why nothing here is a default: an app opts
// in by passing `googleFonts()`, and `defaultFonts()` stays the zero-network answer.
//
// Metric compatibility is the reason the substitution map is short. Carlito/Caladea/
// Tinos/Cousine have the same advance widths as the Word faces they stand in for, so wrap
// and pagination land where Word puts them. Anything else would be a guess that moves line
// breaks, so it is left to the app's own `substitute` map rather than assumed here.
