# @docx-editor.dev/fonts

Metric-compatible, open-licensed substitutes for Word's default fonts, packaged for
shaped (HarfBuzz) measurement in the docx-editor engine.

| Word font       | Substitute       | License |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| Calibri         | Carlito          | SIL OFL |
| Cambria         | Caladea          | SIL OFL |
| Times New Roman | Liberation Serif | SIL OFL |
| Arial           | Liberation Sans  | SIL OFL |
| Courier New     | Liberation Mono  | SIL OFL |

Metric-compatible means identical advance widths: line wrap and pagination land where
Word puts them, even though glyph outlines differ slightly. Documents that need exact
rendering of the real faces should supply licensed bytes via `loadFonts` in
`@docx-editor.dev/core`.

## Usage

```ts
import { loadDefaultFonts, installDefaultFontFaces } from '@docx-editor.dev/fonts';

const fragment = await loadDefaultFonts(); // or { families: ['Calibri'] }

// The editor's `fonts` option accepts the fragment directly —
// createDocxEditor({ container, document: bytes, fonts: fragment })
// or <DocxEditor.Root document={bytes} fonts={fragment} /> in the adapters.
// To merge several origins, use composeFontConfiguration (re-exported by
// @docx-editor.dev/react and @docx-editor.dev/vue).

// Optional paint fidelity: register the substitutes with the browser under the Word
// family names so painted glyphs match the measured metrics.
await installDefaultFontFaces();
```

Nothing loads until you call `loadDefaultFonts`: importing the package fetches no
bytes, and the editor engine never calls in here on its own.

Font binaries ship as separate files (`assets/*.ttf`) fetched lazily per requested
family. Each face's `sha256:` hash is baked at packaging time
(`src/manifest.generated.ts`) and CI-verified against the shipped bytes.

## Google Fonts, on demand

`@docx-editor.dev/fonts/google` ships nothing in the bundle and fetches nothing until a
document names a family the catalog covers.

```ts
import { googleFonts } from '@docx-editor.dev/fonts/google';

// A resolver, not a value: the editor calls it once per load with the families
// the file declares, and only those are fetched.
<DocxEditor.Root document={bytes} fonts={googleFonts()} />;
```

Open a file that uses only Calibri and one family is fetched (Carlito, its
metric-compatible stand-in). Open one that names nothing cataloged and no request is
made at all.

The catalog is generated, closed and pinned to a single google/fonts commit
(`src/google-catalog.generated.ts`, 105 families). A family a document names is only
ever a lookup key, never interpolated into a URL, and every entry carries a baked
`sha256:` that the engine re-derives on admission. Families are included by rule:
all four static faces present, and the shaper's table checks passed. Variable-only
families (Roboto, Arimo, Open Sans, …) are excluded, because the shaper refuses
variation axes and a variable file would render bold at regular weight.

A fetching resolver makes opening a document perform network requests, and the CDN learns
which families a document uses. The engine never supplies one, so opting in stays your call.
`loadDefaultFonts()` remains the zero-network answer, and
`googleFonts({ allow: ['Tinos', 'Lato'] })` narrows what may ever be fetched.

Regenerate the catalog with `bun run google:catalog` (downloads ~90 MB, pins hashes);
`google:check` guards the committed file offline, `google:verify` re-checks it against
the CDN.

## Licenses

The packaged fonts keep their own licenses (see `licenses/`): Carlito and Caladea and
the Liberation family under the SIL Open Font License. The package's own code is
Apache-2.0.
