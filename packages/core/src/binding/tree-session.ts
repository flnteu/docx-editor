//
// Most of what the legacy session exposes exists to express the SECOND model's limits:
// `readOnlyBlockIds`, `readOnlyRegions`, `structuralMutationAllowed` and the
// fully-captured-slice rule are all answers to "can this paragraph's original bytes be

// is a paragraph; unknown content survives because it is in the tree; so those fields
// collapse to a single honest statement of what the part contains.
