// Browser/canvas-backed text measurement for the semantic layout lane.
//
// Layout itself stays DOM-free: this module is an optional adapter of the `TextMeasurer`
// port. The editor composition root creates a 2d canvas context (the only browser seam)
// and injects it here. SSR, tests under happy-dom (no real canvas), and non-browser
// runtimes keep the deterministic fixed measurer.
//
// Font shorthand construction mirrors `semantic-paint.ts` run-style semantics (family,
// point size, bold, italic, super/subscript shrink) so measured advances agree with the
// painted glyphs. Family names are file-derived: only the paint sink's allowlist is
// interpolated into the CSS font shorthand — never an unsanitized string.
//
// Line metrics come from canvas `fontBoundingBox*` (ascent + descent) when the host
// reports them, otherwise a bounded size×1.15 / 0.8 fallback. Paint consumes the
// layout-published line height as an explicit pixel value — never CSS `line-height:
// normal` — so this module must not mount a DOM probe or call `getBoundingClientRect`.
