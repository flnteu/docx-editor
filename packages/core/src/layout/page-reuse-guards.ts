// What keeps each field of a REUSED page current.
//
// A page is reused whole. Convergence appends `previous.pages.slice(...)` and the unchanged
// exit returns the previous pages by identity, so nothing compares a page field by field the
// way `fragmentSignature` compares a fragment. Every field is guarded somewhere else instead,
// and each of those guards is hand-written and lives in a different file.
//
// This is that set, written down and type-checked. A new field on `PageRecord` is a type
// error here until somebody says which mechanism keeps it current, because the failure it
// would otherwise ship is silent: a reused page showing a value the document no longer has.
