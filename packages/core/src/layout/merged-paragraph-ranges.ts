// Giving a merged paragraph's content back its own identity.
//
// A resolved display mode lays a run of paragraphs out as one, because that is what the
// document becomes once its tracked decisions are taken. The layout is right and the identity
// is not: every span in that fragment names the paragraph the merge kept, at an offset in a
// paragraph that does not hold those characters. A resolved view is EDITABLE — the free engine
// renders `proposed` by default — so a click or a keystroke in the merged half would address a
// position the store does not have.
//
// This maps each published range back to the member that contributed it. The member boundaries
// are the members' own model lengths: `piecesOfParagraph` keeps its running offset aligned with
// `paragraphTextOf`, which is the same authority `paragraphOffsetIndex` answers from, so the
// k-th member starts at the sum of the lengths before it.
