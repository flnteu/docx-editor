// Live evaluation of an allowlisted PAGE-family field nested inside an open complex field's
// atomic cached result, or inside a `w:fldSimple` cache.
//
// Both walks skip such an inner field's cached digits and append the projected per-sheet
// value when the inner field's own `end` closes, so a `STYLEREF` wrapping `PAGE` never stamps
// the producer's saved sheet number onto every page. The tracker is LEVEL-AWARE: it records
// the nesting level whose `separate` armed it, and only that level's matching `end` appends
// and disarms. Everything at a DEEPER level while armed — begins, separates, ends, cached
// text — is part of the replaced inner result and is ignored, so a begin/end pair inside a
// tracked result cannot clear tracking mid-field and drop the digits around it. A second
// `separate` at the tracked level (malformed) is ignored the same way: the matched end still
// appends. Any level 2..MAX_FIELD_NESTING may arm when the walk offers it, so a PAGE three or
// four levels down (under an inert REF, say) still evaluates instead of losing its digits.
//
// This tracker owns only that state: which inner field is armed, at which level, and whether
// its cached result was seen and whether any of it was visible. Extracted so the walks stay a
// straight-line reading of the field machine.
