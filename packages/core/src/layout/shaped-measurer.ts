// Exact line metrics and advances, from the font itself (task 7.7).
//
// Every host-side measurement is a fraction out, and the fraction is not cosmetic. Word
// derives single line spacing from the font's ascent and descent. `hhea.lineGap` is external
// leading: Word does not add it to the line box. Including it makes every line a fraction too
// tall, and that fraction accumulates until text paginates earlier than Word.
//
// The font bytes carry the exact numbers, and the shaper already reads them. This adapts
// that shaper to the semantic layout lane's `TextMeasurer` port, so the lane stays DOM-free
// and becomes exact at the same time: advances are summed glyph advances, not estimated
// character widths, and line height is Word's own formula over the real table values.
//
// Order of operations follows Word, and matches the fixed measurer so the two are
// substitutable: shaped advance, then horizontal scaling, then character spacing as an
// absolute per-character addition the scaling does not multiply.
