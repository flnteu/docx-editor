// CT_TblWidth reading, and the reconciliation that turns authored width statements into the
// column grid a table is laid out on.
//
// This is separate from the structural read in `semantic-table.ts` because settling a column
// is not a per-cell read. `w:tblGrid` only seeds the columns, and 17.18.87 settles the rest
// by looking at every cell that covers a column across every row — a whole algorithm with its
// own bounds, reached through a single call once the structural walk has collected the
// claims. Keeping it here leaves that walk a walk, and leaves the width algebra somewhere it
// can be read end to end.
//
// All widths leave here in POINTS — twips are converted once at this boundary, matching
// `geometryOfSection` and `paragraphIndent`.
//
// Every value below is attacker-controlled (a .docx is a zip of XML the author fully
// controls). `resolveColumnWidthsPt` bounds span and column counts before allocation and
// avoids spread over attacker-sized collections — note the claim list it consumes grows with
// the table's CELL count, not its column count, so it must never be spread or passed as
// varargs. Do not relax these limits: hostile inputs can otherwise trigger multi-gigabyte
// allocation attempts or spread-arity failures that vary by JavaScript engine.
//
// Widths resolve to a positive number or not at all. A column that no evidence settles takes
// a bounded share of what is left rather than zero, and no fit may scale a table below one
// point per column — a zero-width column is unrecoverable downstream.
