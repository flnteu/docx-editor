// Stale-safe layout scheduling driven by authoritative model changes (task 9.1).
//
// The store already says exactly what a commit touched — dirty, created and deleted node
// ids, split/join pairs, dependency keys, and an impact class. Layout does not have to
// guess, and it must not: guessing is how a caret ends up drawn against geometry from a
// revision the model has already left behind.
//
// Two properties this owns, and nothing else in the pipeline can:
//
//   SCOPE. The impact class of a commit decides how much of the flow can be affected.
//   A text edit inside one paragraph cannot move a paragraph above it; a split can move
//   everything below it; a page-geometry change moves everything. Scope is accumulated
//   across coalesced changes by WIDENING, never narrowing — two text-local edits in
//   different paragraphs stay text-local over the union of their ids, but one structural
//   edit anywhere makes the batch structural.
//
//   STALENESS. Layout of revision R may only be published while the model is still at R.
//   A result computed against a superseded revision is discarded, not published late and
//   not merged: publishing it would show the user a document that no longer exists. This
//   holds however the work was scheduled, so an async host cannot introduce the race by
//   choosing a slower frame callback.
//
// This schedules and publishes only. Reusing the previous layout for the untouched suffix
// is task 9.3, and the caches it consults are 9.2; both sit behind `run`, which is handed a
// scope this module computed and is free to ignore it and lay out everything.
