// The store and layout agree on where every offset is — checked over real documents.
//
// This is the invariant three separate bugs violated in three different places, which is what
// makes it worth stating once instead of fixing again: a painted span's TEXT LENGTH is not its
// MODEL RANGE. A field occupies one offset and paints its whole cached result, so "Scope of the
// discussions" is twenty-four glyphs over a range of one.
//
// Every consumer that quietly assumed the two were the same broke differently:
//
//   - the paragraph offset walk counted a struck field result twice, so the paragraph measured
//     longer than anything laid out from it and the caret and the keystroke landed at different
//     offsets — click here, type there;
//   - the DOM selection mapper derived an endpoint as `start + textContent.length`, handing back
//     an offset the paragraph does not have, so a caret just after a field could not type;
//   - the composition readback joined the painted text and diffed it against the model, and
//     explained the difference by deleting the field and inserting its own rendering.
//
// None of those were reachable from hand-written XML that nobody thought to write. So the check
// runs over the fixture corpus and states the property directly: what the store says a paragraph
// is worth, layout must lay out — exactly, with no gap and no overlap.
