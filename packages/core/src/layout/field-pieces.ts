// The unit layout measures: one run of text with everything paint will need to draw it.
//
// A "piece" is what the paragraph walk emits and `paragraph-flow.ts` breaks into lines. It is
// deliberately not a run: one run can produce several pieces (a tab splits it), and several runs
// can produce one (a field's cached result). What every piece does carry is its MODEL RANGE, so
// selection, the caret and hit-testing address the store rather than the DOM.
//
// Split out of `field-projection.ts` because these are the vocabulary, not the walk — and that
// module is against the file-size cap.
