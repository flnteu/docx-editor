// Word's paragraph-level pagination controls: widow/orphan, keep-with-next, keep-lines.
//
// These decide WHERE a paragraph is allowed to cross a page boundary, not how it measures.
// `semantic-layout.ts` owns the flow cursor and calls in here for the decision, so the rule
// itself stays a pure function of line counts and can be reasoned about (and tested) without
// a page, a measurer or a DOM.
//
// All three are style-inheritable, so they are read from the CASCADED paragraph property bag
// (`docDefaults` → `basedOn` chain → style → direct), the same bag `w:pageBreakBefore` and
// `w:spacing` are read from. Reading direct `w:pPr` alone would miss every heading that gets
// its `w:keepNext` from the `Heading 1` style — which is all of them.
//
// Everything here fails OPEN. A keep rule that cannot be honoured places the content anyway,
// because Word does the same: a paragraph taller than a page still prints, and a keep chain
// that cannot fit is abandoned rather than looped over.
//
// TABLES — these apply to the BODY flow only, never to paragraphs inside a cell. Row
// pagination is the authority there: `w:cantSplit` (§17.4.6) decides whether a row may be cut,
// and a row moves or splits as ONE unit across all its cells. A cell paragraph asking to keep
// with the next cannot be honoured without moving the whole row, which is a decision
// `w:cantSplit` already owns, and honouring it per cell would tear a row's columns apart at
// different heights. A `w:keepNext` chain that reaches a table therefore stops there
// (unpriceable → the keep is abandoned), which is also what Word does with a heading kept with
// a table it cannot fit beside.
