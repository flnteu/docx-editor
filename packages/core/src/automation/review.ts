// Comments and tracked changes, as the protocol answers them.
//
// NOTHING IS DERIVED HERE. Both are read by `review-reads.ts` in the store lane — the same
// derivation the review rail draws its cards from — and this file only projects those items into
// the protocol's vocabulary: which comment is a reply to which, what Word calls a kind of change,
// and which decisions this engine can actually make. A second derivation would be a second answer
// to "what does this document hold", and the two would part company at the first document neither
// author had in mind.
//
// WHAT IS LEFT OUT OF THE LISTING IS LEFT OUT ON PURPOSE. A structural revision whose exact Word
// subtype this protocol cannot name — a row, a cell, a section, the table grid — is omitted from
// `revisionReads`, because an object whose `type` we cannot publish is worse than an absence.
// Collection membership is therefore not the collection decision set: `acceptAll` / `rejectAll`
// still resolve every store-resolvable revision, including a complete tracked row
// (`revisionKind: structural` and `readOnly: false`), and refuse atomically when any `readOnly`
// item remains.
