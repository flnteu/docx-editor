// Every read the protocol answers, derived from one canonical package.
//
// INTERNAL. There is exactly one implementation of "what are this story's paragraphs", "what
// does this paragraph say" and "what is between these two positions", and both hosts run it
// over the package their port hands back. That is the whole reason the browser host cannot
// drift from the headless one: it is not that two implementations agree, it is that there is
// one implementation.
//
// TEXT COMES FROM `paragraphTextOf`, the same offset authority the tree ops validate against,
// so a length a consumer reads and an offset it then writes at are the same vocabulary. A
// paragraph text derived any other way — a layout span, a painted node, a projection — reads a
// field or a note differently and puts every subsequent offset one character out.
//
// A DOCUMENT IS SEVERAL STORIES, and each is read on its own. The body, a header or footer per
// variant per section, and one story per footnote and endnote: they live in different parts, hold
// their own paragraphs, and commit through their own transaction scope. Nothing here flattens them
// together, and a story's reads carry the scope its writes go through — so a handle naming a
// header cannot be planned against the body by accident.
//
// PARAGRAPH ORDER IS READING ORDER, descending into tables and block-level content controls.
// Word's paragraph collection contains cell paragraphs, and an object model that skipped them
// would report a document shorter than the one on screen — then place an insertion in the wrong
// paragraph, because the caller counted with a different list than the engine writes with.
