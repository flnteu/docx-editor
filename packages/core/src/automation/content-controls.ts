// A CONTROL IS ADDRESSED BY ITS CANONICAL NODE, and `w:id` is answered as metadata beside it.
// The attribute is optional in the schema and unique nowhere, so a file may write none, or write
// 5 twice; a lane that used it as identity would leave the first control unreachable and make the
// second pair one object. Nesting is answered as nesting rather than flattened, because the
// controls of a control are not the controls of the story that holds it.
//
// Everything here is derived per operation from the current package. A control's text, its lock
// and the paragraphs it holds are all facts about the document NOW, and a read remembered from
// when the handle was minted would describe the document as it was.
