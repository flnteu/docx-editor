// Handle minting and resolution.
//
// INTERNAL. A handle is a name this table invented, mapped privately to the engine identity
// it stands for. Consumers get the name; nothing else ever leaves.
//
// Three properties matter and all three are easy to lose:
//
// STABLE — the same document object asked for twice yields the same ref, so an object model
// can hold a reference across batches and compare two references for identity. A table that
// minted per read would make every held reference a distinct object naming the same thing.
//
// STORY-QUALIFIED — a body ref names ONE story: the main body, a header or footer of a given
// section and variant, or one footnote. So does a paragraph ref, and it carries its story with it.
// Without that, "the body" meant whatever story the reader happened to be in and a scripted edit
// followed the user's caret into a header; and a paragraph ref could be planned against the wrong
// part, which is an offset landing in different text rather than anything that looks like an error.
//
// HOST-SCOPED — every ref carries a token drawn from the platform CSPRNG when the table is
// created. Without it, refs were numbered per host and every host's first paragraph was
// `paragraph:1`: two hosts open on two different documents accepted each other's refs and
// resolved them against their own tree, so a ref legitimately obtained from one document named
// a paragraph in another. An opaque name that collides is not opaque. The token makes a ref
// neither transplantable nor guessable, which is what an object model behind a transport needs.
//
// The ORDINAL half is still allocated in first-seen order per kind, so two hosts asked the same
// questions in the same order agree about everything except the token — which is what lets the
// differential tests compare two hosts' responses whole, normalizing only the token.
//
// Lookup is by Map, never by object key: a forged ref is untrusted input, and `__proto__` as
// a property name on a plain object is the prototype-pollution hazard this avoids by
// construction.
