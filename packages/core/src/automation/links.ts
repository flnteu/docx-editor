// Where a stretch of text points, and what points at it.
//
// TWO KINDS OF TARGET, one string. A `w:hyperlink` either names a relationship — an address
// outside the document — or a `w:anchor`, a bookmark inside it. The protocol answers one string
// for both because that is what a target IS to a caller: `https://…` or `#name`. What it never
// answers is an authored string the engine would refuse to open. A file's own `javascript:` is
// preserved on save (round-tripping never rewrites a document) but it is reported as no target at
// all, and an AUTHORED one is refused before it reaches the package.
//
// A BOOKMARK IS A RANGE, and the file writes it as two markers that find each other by `@w:id`:
// `w:bookmarkStart` carries the name, `w:bookmarkEnd` closes it, and either may be missing or
// duplicated because a `.docx` is attacker-controlled. So the derivation pairs them, bounds itself,
// and answers only the ones that actually enclose something addressable. A start with no end has
// no range — reporting it as a zero-length one at its own position would invent a bookmark the
// document does not have.
