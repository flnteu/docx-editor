// How a tracked change LOOKS.
//
// OOXML says nothing about this. A revision carries `@w:author` and no colour: Word assigns
// colours per author, in the application, and the choice never reaches the file. So this is
// presentation policy, and it belongs where a host can replace it — the colours resolve through
// `--doc-review-author-N` tokens rather than literals, and the author-to-slot mapping is one
// pure function.
//
// The decorations follow Word: an insertion is underlined, a deletion struck through, and the
// two halves of a MOVE are drawn distinguishably from an ordinary delete/insert pair, because
// they are one decision and a reviewer resolving one half resolves both.
