/**
 * `@docx-editor.dev/core/contracts/interaction` — semantic addressing and interaction outcomes.
 *
 * Semantic identities and targets: the vocabulary a caller uses to say WHICH text it means,
 * independent of layout, DOM or any editing engine's positions. Plus the outcome type an
 * interaction attempt answers with. That is the whole module.
 *
 * It used to be 599 lines. An "interaction frame" lived here — a revision-tagged projection
 * of display, page geometry, caret and selection overlays, focus, composition and
 * accessibility, plus a typed pointer-intent dispatch protocol and a render IR of glyph
 * runs — and every one of those declarations was consumed by exactly nothing. They
 * described an architecture the engine does not use: the paginated surface owns pointer
 * interaction internally and paints through `Editor.attach`, so no frame was ever published
 * and no intent ever dispatched.
 * THREE of them (`CaretGeometry`, `HitTestOptions`, `ShapedCluster`) also collided by name
 * with the REAL, differently-shaped types in `layout/`, so the published contract carried a
 * second definition of a live concept and `import { ShapedCluster }` meant different things
 * depending on which module you reached for.
 * `InteractionFrameId` and a frame-tagged `SemanticSelection` outlived that cut. Both were
 * the same mistake: the id was a placeholder nothing ever minted (`focus` returned a literal
 * `{ value: 0 }`), and the selection could not be CONSTRUCTED without one, which made it a
 * fourth name-collision with the real `SemanticSelection` in `layout/` that a caller could
 * never actually satisfy.
 *
 * CONTRACT ONLY — declarations, not an implementation.
 *
