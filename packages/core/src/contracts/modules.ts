/**
 * `@docx-editor.dev/core/contracts/modules` — the `EditorModule` seam.
 *
 * How a paid or optional capability contributes to the engine without the free tier importing
 * it: the review module and custom nodes both arrive through here, and their absence leaves the
 * corresponding chrome disabled with the engine's own reason.
 *
 * NOT a plugin system. The shape is closed: every contribution point is named
 * here, core iterates registered modules at its existing dispatch points, and
 * core never imports a capability package. A capability absent from this file
 * is not extendable from outside — deliberately, so the one-pipeline principle
 * survives the packaging boundary.
 * The free engine behaves identically with an empty registry: documents
 * round-trip losslessly, revisions render in their final-state projection, and
 * the review chrome slots stay disabled with the engine's own reason.
