// The review queue: every pending decision in the document, derived from the TREE.
//
// Deliberately not from laid-out spans. Layout is a VIEW — the proposed-result mode drops every
// deletion and the original mode drops every insertion — so a queue derived from spans empties
// by half the moment a reader switches view, and the changes that vanished become unreachable
// from the surface that is supposed to resolve them. The queue is a property of the document.
//
// SO IT IS DERIVED IN THE STORE LANE, where every lane can reach it. The review rail asks this
// question to draw cards, and an automation host asks it to answer "what comments does this
// document hold" to a script; a lane that could not import the derivation would have written a
// second one, and two derivations of a reviewer's queue disagree eventually — a comment listed
// on screen and missing from the object model, or a change the pane offers to accept and the
// script cannot find. Layout re-exports what is here and adds only GEOMETRY: where a card sits
// beside the page, which is the one thing the tree cannot answer.

 *
 * Three things keep it from over-claiming. A ZERO-WIDTH range is evidence of nothing — the same
 * rule the comment threading uses, and a format or paragraph-mark revision decorates no
 * characters at all. A comment already stated to be a REPLY to another comment is not claimed
 * directly, because a stated link always beats an inferred one. And the FIRST revision on a span
 * wins, so a card cannot claim a reply another card already holds.
 *
 * The WHOLE conversation moves, not its head. A change's card renders `replyIds` as a flat list,
 * so linking only the top comment of a thread left every answer to that answer rendered by
 * nobody: reply twice to one change and the second reply existed in `comments.xml` and appeared
 * nowhere on screen. Descendants ride along, in the order they were authored.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT, and that is load-bearing. The session re-runs this over a list whose comments are
 * ALREADY linked, so a pass that only ever added links left a stale `parentRevisionId` behind
 * when a keystroke shifted the revision's offsets out from under it — the rail filters such a
 * comment out of its roots, and with no revision claiming it any more the card vanished until
 * the next full re-derivation. Every link is rebuilt from the ranges on every pass.
