// Authoring a custom node that carries a payload, and taking one back.
//
// ONE TRANSACTION, three writes: the customXml data part (created if the document has none for
// the namespace), the node inside it, and the `w:sdt` in the body whose `w:dataBinding` names
// that node. Partial application is the failure this must not have — a control bound to a store
// that was never written is a document Word offers to repair, and repairing it means throwing
// the control away.
//
// The order is deliberate. The store goes in first, so the id the binding quotes is one the
// package already holds by the time the body references it; the body edit is last, so a refusal
// anywhere (a locked paragraph, an offset out of range, a protected document) abandons the store
// write with it rather than leaving a payload nothing points at.
//
// WHY THE STORE IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH. A bound control with no type child is read-only in Word:
// the text is painted from the xpath and a user cannot type into it (verified,
// `sdt-custom-node-databinding-word-roundtrip.docx`). This engine refuses content edits inside a
// bound control for its own reasons — see `contentControlBindingRefusal` — so the two agree. The
// page and the payload cannot drift, and nothing here has to reconcile them.
