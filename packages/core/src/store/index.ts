/**
 * `@docx-editor.dev/core/store` — the canonical OOXML tree and the only write path into it.
 *
 * Bytes become a typed-where-layout-needs-it, generic-everywhere-else tree. Every mutation is a
 * `TreeDocOp` addressed by node id plus UTF-16 offset, applied in one transaction, so a batch
 * refused halfway leaves the document exactly as it was.
 *
 * This is also the trust boundary: zip and XML limits, entity-free parsing, OPC name validation,
 * and inert executable content all live here, because everything downstream assumes a sanitized
 * projection.
