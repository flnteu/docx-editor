// The link between a control in the body and its payload in the store, read in both directions.
//
// `custom-xml-part.ts` owns the PART, `custom-xml-nodes.ts` owns the NODES inside it. This owns
// the `w:dataBinding` that ties one to the other: what to write when a node is authored, and how
// to read a binding back to the node id it names — which is what the sweep and the export path
// both need, because neither can ask a host which controls exist.
//
// ONE PREFIX, ALWAYS THE SAME. `w:xpath` steps resolve through `w:prefixMappings`, so the prefix
// is private to the binding and nothing outside it can observe the choice. Fixing it means the
// binding a document carries is a pure function of the node it names, so re-authoring the same
// node produces the same bytes.
//
// SECURITY: a binding read back here came from a file the sender wrote. The xpath is matched
// against the ONE shape this library authors and anything else is ignored — never evaluated,
// never resolved, never used to reach a part. A sender that writes their own xpath gets a
// control this engine treats as bound and does not sweep, which is the fail-closed answer: a
// payload nothing recognizes is left alone rather than deleted.
