// `text/html` WITHOUT a `text/plain` flavour used to paste nothing at all, silently: the
// handler prevented the browser's default and then returned on the empty string. A few
// real applications write only the HTML flavour, and for them the editor simply looked
// broken.
//
// So the HTML flavour is read for its TEXT, never for its structure. This is a string
// transform end to end: no `innerHTML`, no `DOMParser`, no DOM built from the payload at
// all, so there is no markup sink to escape from. Whatever comes out is inserted through
// the same path typed text takes, which only ever produces text runs — the worst case for
// a payload this function mis-reads is odd characters, never live markup.
