// Font configuration composition — the ONE documented way the three font origins
// (explicit app bytes, embedded document faces, substitute packages) become a single
// immutable `FontConfiguration`.
//
// Precedence is positional and first-wins: the base's sources beat every fragment's, and
// an earlier fragment beats a later one, keyed by (family, weight, style) — the same key
// `createFontResourceSnapshot` uses, which THROWS on duplicates. Composition is therefore
// also the dedup point: without it, handing an explicit Calibri and an embedded Calibri
// to the snapshot is a construction error rather than a precedence decision.
//
// Substitutions concatenate first-wins by their `from` face — and any substitution whose
// `from` is covered by a direct source is DROPPED here. The resource snapshot consults
// substitutions BEFORE sources, so an unfiltered Calibri→Carlito entry would beat real
// Calibri bytes; the contract says a direct source always wins, and this filter is where
// that promise is kept.
