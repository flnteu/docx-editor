// behaviour the browser already ships — including the parts nobody remembers, like
// double-click selecting a word differently per locale.
//
// So the browser owns the GESTURE and layout keeps owning the GEOMETRY. The painter already
// stamps every span with the source range it came from, which is enough to turn a DOM
// anchor/focus into a paragraph id and a UTF-16 offset:
//
//   span[data-paragraph-id="p3"][data-start="12"] + 4 characters into its text -> (p3, 16)
//
// This reads DOM IDENTITY and text offsets — never `getBoundingClientRect`, never a computed
// style. Nothing here derives geometry, so the layout records remain the only answer to
// where anything is; this only decides WHICH characters the user gestured over.
