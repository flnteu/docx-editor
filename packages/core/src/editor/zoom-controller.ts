// Keeping a fit mode fitted: measure the room, ask `zoom-fit.ts` for the scale, apply it.
//
// Split out of `docx-editor.ts` because that file is already near its max-lines cap and this
// is the DOM half of the feature — a `ResizeObserver`, a computed-style read and a frame
// callback. The arithmetic lives next door and is testable without any of it.
//
// THE MEASUREMENT IS THE CONTENT BOX, not the width. `clientWidth` includes padding, and
// padding on the scroll container is exactly how the chrome around the page reserves room:
// the comments rail sets `padding-right`, the docked navigation pane sets
// `padding-inline-start`. Subtracting both leaves the room the page actually has, which is
// why "opening comments shrinks the document" needs no wiring — the observer fires on the
// content-box change and the next fit is simply smaller.
