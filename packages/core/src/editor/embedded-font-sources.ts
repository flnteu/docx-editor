// Embedded document faces as shaping font sources (font-resolution-overhaul 2.1/2.2).
//
// `readEmbeddedFonts` hands back deobfuscated bytes and a CLAIMED family/style, asserting
// nothing about validity — admitting a face stays the font resource lane's job, behind its
// validator and caps. This module only reshapes that claim into the `FontSource` contract
// and applies the rules composition needs before the snapshot sees the bytes:
//
// - Request validity: the family is attacker-controlled, and a family the request
//   contract refuses (empty or whitespace-only) would THROW out of `fontRequestKey`
//   during composition — failing the whole resolution, explicit sources included, over
//   one crafted face. Such faces drop HERE, per-face, with a typed report.
// - Per-face bytes: a face larger than the configuration's `maxFontBytes` is dropped
//   HERE, because `createLayoutShaping` treats an oversized source as a configuration
//   error and fails the WHOLE configuration — right for app-supplied bytes, wrong for a
//   face an attacker put in a file.
// - Aggregate: embedded faces admit oldest-first until the shared aggregate budget is
//   exhausted; the rest drop. A file must not be able to spend the whole budget explicit
//   sources also draw on.
// - Shadowed faces: a face whose (family, weight, style) an explicit source already
//   covers can never win composition, so it is skipped BEFORE it spends budget or
//   hashing time — silently, because being overridden is precedence, not failure.
//
// Every drop is returned as a typed report, so the editor can say WHICH face fell and why
// rather than silently measuring it with the fallback.
