// The two-way selection mirror and the IME lane (paginated-surface seam).
//
// The painted pages hold the browser's own selection, so there are two copies of one fact:
// the model's and the DOM's. This module owns the traffic between them in both directions —
// reading a gesture back into the model, writing the model back out, and deciding WHICH of
// the two is the newer whenever a repaint finds them disagreeing — plus the one lane where
// the DOM legitimately gets ahead of the model and cannot be stopped: an IME composition.
//
// SELECTION GESTURES ARE THE BROWSER'S. Drag, double-click for a word, triple-click for a
// paragraph, shift-click to extend, and selecting across a page boundary all come free
// because the painted spans are real text. Re-implementing them from records is how a
// surface ends up feeling worse than a textarea. Layout still owns geometry: what comes back
// from the DOM is which CHARACTERS were gestured over, never where they are.
