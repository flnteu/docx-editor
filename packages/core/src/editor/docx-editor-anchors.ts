// Where a review card sits beside the page.
//
// One index per layout, covering every story a card can be anchored in: the body, the
// headers and footers, and the notes. Split out of the editor facade because it is pure over
// a published layout — it reads records and returns geometry, and nothing about it needs the
// editor's state.
//
// The recurring subtlety is that a fragment answers for more than the paragraph it is named
// after. A resolved display mode publishes a merged run as ONE fragment under the survivor's
// identity, so a card anchored in an absorbed member has no fragment of its own. Registering
// only `fragment.paragraphId` left those cards with no geometry, and the rail drops a card it
// cannot place.
