// Word's "field shading: when selected", which is a CARET question, not a layout one.

// would put the caret into the per-block cache key and remeasure the document on every arrow
// press; resolving it in paint would rebuild spans just as often. Both are the wrong lane for a
// background colour.
//
// So layout marks which spans ARE fields (`data-field-atom`, painted once) and this toggles one
// class as the caret moves — the same division the open review item already uses. Cost is one
// class removal and one query per caret move, against a document that never relayouts.

 * selection. Focus and IME composition are deliberately NOT part of that test — Word keeps a
 * field shaded while the caret is in it, and losing the shading on every blur would flicker it
 * away each time the user reached for the toolbar.
