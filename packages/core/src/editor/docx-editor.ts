// The `Editor` facade over the paginated surface.
//
// `createDocxEditor` implements the FULL `Editor` contract over the paginated surface —
// the document session, semantic layout and painted pages. This is the composition root
// the framework adapters mount.
//
// - REAL: load/save, the exec subset below (marks, mark attributes via `setMarkAttr`,
//   alignment, indent, line break, undo/redo, semantic setSelection, selection-addressed
//   insert/delete text), selection formatting, `isActive` for marks and alignment, page
//   setup, page counts, the cached snapshot (with canUndo/canRedo),
//   change/selectionChange/error events, focus, destroy, attach/detach, `query` for
//   `selectedText` and `selectionFormatting`, and the document catalogs
//   (`getDocumentFonts`/`getDocumentStyles`, derived from the canonical trees).
// THE GEOMETRY/INTERACTION CLUSTER IS GONE, not stubbed. `getInteractionFrame`, `hitTest`,
// `dispatchInteraction`, `resolvePointer`, the caret and selection rect readers and the
// accessibility observation were all placeholders here, and none of them had a caller. They
// were removed from the contract rather than filled in, because the honest-empty rule does
// NOT extend to them: `getComments()` returning `[]` is a true statement about a document,
// while `hitTest` returning `null` is indistinguishable from "you clicked the page margin",
// so a caller could not tell an unimplemented member from a real answer. `getPageGeometry`
// is the one survivor and is now REAL — it had the cluster's only consumer, and returning
// `[]` had silently made both Vue rulers render nothing.
//
// Filling any of these in later lights up whichever control reads it, with no change to
// callers — which is the point of wiring the full contract now.
//
// STATE TICK + CACHED SNAPSHOT (the external-store contract).
//
// The facade keeps a monotonic `stateVersion`, bumped at EVERY place observable state can
// move: a committed change, a selection move, zoom, load success AND failure, the async
// font remount (which goes through `mountBytes`), attach/detach, and destroy. `snapshot()`
// derives lazily ONCE per version, deep-freezes, and returns the SAME reference until the
// next bump — `useSyncExternalStore`'s getSnapshot contract, and N subscribers pay one
// derivation instead of N. When it re-derives, the previous `formatting` and `page`
// sub-objects are reused if value-equal, so selector results stay reference-stable too.
