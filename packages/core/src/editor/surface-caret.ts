// The engine's own insertion point for the paginated surface.
//
// The painted pages are contenteditable, so the browser draws the caret itself — one DEVICE
// pixel, which on a 2x display is a hairline that reads as a rendering artefact rather than
// a cursor. Every desktop word processor draws a two-pixel insertion point, so the engine
// paints its own and suppresses the native one for exactly as long as it does.
//
// It also appears where the native caret does not. An EMPTY paragraph paints no text span,
// so the browser has no inline box to size an insertion point against and pressing Enter
// left the user with no visible cursor at all; `caretAt` resolves against the LINE record,
// which layout publishes whether or not any run landed on it.
//
// GEOMETRY COMES FROM LAYOUT, never from the DOM. `caretAt` answers where a model position
// sits, and the painter positions every fragment, row, cell and line by subtracting its
// parent's box from that SAME page-content coordinate space — so the caret can be placed
// inside `.docx-page-content` with no remeasurement and no per-nesting arithmetic, and it
// lands correctly inside a table cell for the same reason body text does.
//
// The element is FURNITURE, not model text. It carries `data-docx-marker`, the attribute
// `positionFromDomPoint` already refuses for painted non-model content: without it a
// selection endpoint resolved through the caret would map into the adjacent run and every
// offset after it would come back wrong. It is `contenteditable=false`, `aria-hidden` and
// pointer/selection inert for the same reason, and it is appended to the page CONTENT box
// rather than to a line or a fragment, because those are the elements whose CHILD INDICES
// dom-selection reads — adding a child to one of them would shift them.
//
// Everything here fails soft. A range selection, an unfocused surface, an active IME
// composition, a position layout does not place, or a page that is not materialized all
// leave the native caret alone rather than leaving the user with no caret at all.
