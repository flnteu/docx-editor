// Hyperlink navigation over the painted pages (paginated-surface seam).
//
// THE HOST PAGE NEVER NAVIGATES. Painted links carry a real `href` so they announce as links,
// copy as links and print as links — which also means a browser left to itself would follow
// one and unload the editor, taking every unsaved edit with it. Every click on an anchor
// inside the pages is prevented here, unconditionally and regardless of pointer mode, and
// what happens next is a decision this module makes.
//
// THREE OUTCOMES, and only three:
//
//   internal link  -> scroll to the bookmark and put the caret there. Never leaves the page.
//   external link  -> hand the host a popover request. Ctrl/Cmd+Click activates directly.
//   anything else  -> nothing. A drag that ENDED on a link is a selection, not a click on it;
//                     an inert link (refused scheme, dangling relationship) has no target;
//                     a furniture link in a header is read-only in this slice.
//
// `window.open` is called from ONE place in the whole engine — `openExternal` below — and
// only ever with the sanitized projection, never with an authored target.
