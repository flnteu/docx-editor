# @docx-editor.dev/editor-api

An **Office.js-compatible editing API** for DOCX. It implements the Word JavaScript object model —
`context.document.body.paragraphs`, `load()` then `sync()`, `search()`, `getFirstOrNullObject()` —
so code written for a Word add-in compiles and runs here.

Describe work against objects, and one `sync()` sends it as a single ordered batch that either
applies whole or not at all. The same code drives bytes on a server and a document a reader
already has open in a page.

```bash
npm install @docx-editor.dev/editor-api
```

## On a server

The default entry needs no browser and nothing to mount. It opens DOCX bytes, edits them, and
hands them back.

```ts
import { readFile, writeFile } from 'node:fs/promises';
import { DocxEditor } from '@docx-editor.dev/editor-api';

const runtime = await DocxEditor.createServer(await readFile('contract.docx'), {
  author: 'Review bot',
});
try {
  const filled = await runtime.run(async (context) => {
    const matches = context.document.body.search('{{cap}}', { matchCase: true });
    matches.load();
    await context.sync(); //  one round trip: now you know what was found

    for (const match of matches.items) match.insertText('$500k', 'Replace');
    await context.sync(); //  one atomic batch: all of the writes, or none
    return matches.items.length;
  });
  console.log(`replaced ${filled}`);
  await writeFile('contract.filled.docx', await runtime.save());
} finally {
  runtime.dispose();
}
```

`createServer` finishes its bounded parse before its promise resolves and does not retain the input
`Uint8Array`; you may reuse or transfer that buffer afterward. Every `save()` returns a fresh,
caller-owned `Uint8Array`, so transferring or mutating one result does not affect the runtime or a
later save. Detached edits remain detached until your application explicitly loads the returned
bytes into a live editor.

## In the browser

The browser entry takes an editor the host already created, from `@docx-editor.dev/react` or a
plain page, and drives it in place. Edits land in the open document with the reader's undo
stack intact. There is no `save()`: the host saves as it already did.

```ts
import { DocxEditor } from '@docx-editor.dev/editor-api/browser';

const runtime = DocxEditor.createBrowser(editor, { author: 'Demo Reviewer' });
await runtime.run(async (context) => {
  const heading = context.document.body.paragraphs.getFirstOrNullObject();
  heading.load('text');
  await context.sync();

  if (!heading.isNullObject) heading.font.bold = true;
  await context.sync();
});
```

Import it from `/browser` deliberately: reaching a live editor means reaching the painted engine,
and a server holding bytes should not pay for that.

`author` is optional for source compatibility and ordinary edits, but required by
`Range.insertComment()` and `Comment.reply()`. A missing identity refuses with `NotSupported`; a
live comment write also requires the Pro review module and a writable editing mode. There is no
static comment-write capability because those conditions are dynamic, so callers should handle the
typed refusal from the call or `sync()`.

`range.insertComment(text)` creates a top-level comment over that exact range and returns the new
`Comment`. Collapsed ranges create insertion-point comments. Empty text and ranges crossing table
cells are refused; duplicate author names are ordinary OOXML and are not deduplicated.

`Comment.delete()` removes a root comment, its replies, and its anchors. `CommentReply.delete()`
removes only that reply and preserves the parent and siblings. Several deletes queued before one
`sync()` are one atomic transaction and one browser Undo unit. Browser comment writes require the
Pro review module and a writable, attached editor; server writes are provided by this Pro-licensed
runtime. Root creation follows the same browser gate and is one Undo unit.

`document.revisions` is the main-body story. `Body.revisions` is story-scoped: a header, footer,
or note collection names that story only. `items` contains revisions this API can publish as typed
Word objects. Structural cards whose exact subtype cannot be named are omitted from `items` and
remain preserved in the file. Collection membership is not the collection decision set:
`acceptAll()` and `rejectAll()` still resolve every store-resolvable revision in that story —
including a complete tracked row — and refuse atomically if any `readOnly` or otherwise unsupported
revision remains. They never resolve only the listed subset. Handle a `NotImplemented` refusal and
leave the document unchanged, or let a reviewer resolve the remaining markup in Word. Browser
decisions join the editor's Undo stack, with one collection decision as one Undo unit.

## Programming model

- A property you did not `load()` throws instead of answering `undefined`, so a typo fails at
  the read rather than producing a wrong document later.
- `sync()` is the only round trip. Everything queued between two syncs is one ordered batch,
  applied atomically.
- Objects are proxies into a document the runtime owns and live inside `run`. Keeping one past
  the callback, or past `dispose()`, is an error rather than a stale read; to keep one across
  syncs deliberately, hand it to `context.trackedObjects`.
- `getFirstOrNullObject` / `getLastOrNullObject` answer an object whose `isNullObject` is
  `true`, which is the difference between "no such heading" and a crash.
- Review timestamps come from untrusted, optional OOXML attributes. `Comment.creationDate`,
  `CommentReply.creationDate`, and `Revision.date` are `Date | null`; narrow `null` before calling
  `Date` methods.

`runtime.capabilities` says what the host behind a runtime can do: `save` is false in the
browser; `selection`, `scrolling` and `layout` are false on a server. It is frozen for the
life of the runtime, so one read stays true.

## Entries

| Entry                                 | Use when                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `@docx-editor.dev/editor-api`         | Servers, workers, build scripts: bytes in, bytes out |
| `@docx-editor.dev/editor-api/browser` | A page, driving an editor the host already created   |

Both entries export the same vocabulary — the lifecycle types, the object model and the error
type — so consumer code compiles against either. They differ by one member: `createBrowser`.

## Office.js compatibility

The API is compatible with a documented subset of Word's JavaScript object model, so a call
site written against that vocabulary compiles here. It is not Office.js: it does not run in an
Office add-in host and depends on no Microsoft package. Every type in the surface is authored
in this repository.

The supported subset and its documented omissions (tables, images, repeating sections, custom
XML mapping) are listed in
[the Office.js compatibility page](https://www.docx-editor.dev/docs/latest/editor-api/office-js-api).
