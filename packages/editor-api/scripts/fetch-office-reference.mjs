/**
 * Fetches the current stable `@types/office-js` release, verifies its
 * integrity against the npm registry, extracts the manifest-selected
 * `Word.*` subset, and regenerates the checked-in normalized reference
 * fixture + provenance record.
 *
 * ## Network use
 *
 * This is the ONLY script in this task that touches the network. It is
 * invoked by the scheduled `.github/workflows/office-compat-drift.yml`
 * workflow, or manually by a maintainer — never by `bun test`, `bun run
 * typecheck`, `bun run build`, or `bun install`. See
 * `packages/editor-api/compat/README.md` for the offline-CI guarantee.
 *
 * ## What this does NOT do
 *
 * It never writes Microsoft's declaration *source* to the repository —
 * only the normalized facts (symbol/member names, parameter/return
 * shapes, requirement sets, upstream UIDs) that `extractWordReference`
 * pulls out of it, plus provenance for exactly what was fetched.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/fetch-office-reference.mjs [--version <semver>]
 *                                           [--check [--json <path>] | --adopt]
 *
 *   --version <semver>  Pin a specific @types/office-js version instead of
 *                        the current "latest" dist-tag.
 *   --check             Regenerate into a temp comparison file and exit
 *                        non-zero if it differs from the checked-in
 *                        fixture, without overwriting anything (used by the
 *                        scheduled drift-check workflow). Also prints a
 *                        symbol/member-level delta (added/removed/changed
 *                        symbols and members, including overload-level
 *                        changes) via `reference-diff.mjs`, which the
 *                        scheduled workflow embeds in the drift issue body.
 *   --json <path>       With `--check`, also write that result as JSON, so
 *                        the workflow can branch on it instead of parsing
 *                        prose out of stdout.
 *   --adopt             Adopt a *shape-identical* upstream release: no symbol
 *                        and no member moved, so there is nothing about the
 *                        API for a human to review. Rewrites the fixture (its
 *                        `generatedFrom.version` carries the release), the
 *                        provenance record, and the source-commit pin.
 *                        Refuses (exit 1) the moment any symbol or member
 *                        differs.
 *
 * ## Which drift a machine may adopt
 *
 * `compat/definitely-typed-commits.json` records the reviewed DefinitelyTyped
 * source commit for each adopted @types/office-js version. A version bump is
 * how real upstream drift arrives, so `--check` must be able to fetch,
 * extract, and diff a brand-new, not-yet-adopted version — it never skips or
 * aborts before computing the delta just because no one has reviewed it yet
 * (see `checkForDrift`).
 *
 * The write paths are stricter, and split by what actually changed:
 *
 * - `regenerate` (plain `node fetch-office-reference.mjs` /
 *   `compat:fetch-reference`) hard-fails for a version with no pin. It
 *   overwrites the checked-in, trusted `compat/reference/word.reference.json`
 *   and `compat/provenance.json`, so it may never turn an unreviewed release
 *   into trusted committed input.
 * - `adoptShapeIdenticalDrift` (`--adopt`) is the one path that may resolve a
 *   pin on its own, and only for a release whose manifest-selected shape is
 *   byte-identical to what is already checked in. The pin it writes is proved,
 *   not assumed: `definitely-typed-commit.mjs` accepts a commit only when that
 *   commit's `index.d.ts` matches the integrity-verified tarball's bytes. When
 *   any symbol or member moved, the delta is a fact about the API and this
 *   path refuses, leaving the scheduled workflow to open a review issue.
