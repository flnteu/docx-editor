// Bookmarks: the names a document gives to stretches of itself.
//
// A BOOKMARK IS ITS NAME. OOXML writes it as a pair of markers around the text, and the name is the
// only thing that identifies it — so this object is a name plus the range those markers currently
// enclose, and a bookmark whose markers left with the text they surrounded refuses rather than
// answering where they used to be.
//
// `start` AND `end` ARE NOT HERE, and `delete` is not either. The first two are document-wide
// character offsets — the coordinate space already de-selected on `Range` for the same reason: this
// engine addresses positions as a paragraph identity plus a UTF-16 offset, and a whole-document
// counter would go stale under every edit above it. `delete` would have to remove a marker pair,
// which is not an operation the canonical write path offers. Both are recorded as omissions in
// `compat/manifest.json` rather than shipped as members that refuse.
