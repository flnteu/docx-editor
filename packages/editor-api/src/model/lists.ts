// Lists: the numbers a document puts in front of paragraphs.
//
// A LIST IS NOT AN ELEMENT. OOXML has no list: it has paragraphs that each name a `w:numId`, and a
// list is the set of paragraphs that name the same one. So `List#id` is that number, `paragraphs` is
// the set, and a list exists exactly as long as some paragraph is still in it.
//
// WHAT IS MISSING IS MISSING BECAUSE IT IS PAINTED, NOT AUTHORED. `ListItem#listString` — the "3."
// or "iv)" a reader sees — is computed while laying the document out, by a counter that walks the
// story applying `numbering.xml` and its abstract-numbering indirection, restarts and overrides. It
// is not in the paragraph, and answering it here would mean a second counter that disagrees with
// the one on screen the first time a document overrides a level. `siblingIndex` is the same counter
// read differently. Both are recorded as omissions in `compat/manifest.json`.
