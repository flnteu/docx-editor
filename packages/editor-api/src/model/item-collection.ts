// What every collection in this model does the same way.
//
// A COLLECTION IS NOT AN OBJECT THE HOST NAMES. It is a question about something that is: "the
// paragraphs of this story", "the lists in it", "the replies to this comment". So a collection
// addresses itself through its OWNER's path — derived, not copied, so that a collection built from a
// range the current batch is still resolving becomes addressable exactly when the range does — and
// each subclass supplies the one read that answers its question.
//
// `items` IS THE LOADED ANSWER, never a live view. A collection loaded in one batch describes the
// document as of that batch; members added afterwards are not in it, and reaching them means loading
// again. The alternative — re-reading on every property access — would make reading a property send
// a batch, which is the one thing this runtime does not do.
//
// AN ITEM ACCESSOR IS ALSO A READ. `getFirst()` answers a proxy immediately and finds out during the
// sync whether it was there; an empty collection then fails `ItemNotFound`, reported against the
// consumer's own `getFirst()` call. The `…OrNullObject` form answers the same kind of proxy and lets
// it say `isNullObject` instead, which is what code that expects nothing wants.
//
// ITS OWN MODULE, and importing no other model class: seven collections extend the base here, and
// each of them imports the item type it builds. A base class living beside one of those subclasses
// makes the whole model's evaluation order depend on which file an entry happens to import first —
// which is exactly the cycle that had `ListCollection` extending an uninitialised class.
