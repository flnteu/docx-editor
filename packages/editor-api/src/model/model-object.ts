// What every object in this model does the same way.
//
// The runtime's `ClientObject` decides the LIFETIME rules — when a call is refused, what a released
// object answers, where loaded values live. This adds the three things that are the same for every
// document object above it: reading text into a loaded property, queueing a command whose only
// answer is that the batch committed, and queueing a command that DOES answer something (the range
// an insertion occupies, the paragraph it created) so the caller has an object to carry on with.
//
// It imports no other model class ON PURPOSE. `Body`, `Paragraph`, `Range` and the collections all
// reference each other, and every one of them extends this — so a single import from here into any
// of them would make the base class's own evaluation depend on a class that is still being defined.
// The helpers take a settle callback instead, and each class builds its own objects.
