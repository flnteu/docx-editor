// Footnotes and endnotes: text that belongs to the document but not to its flow.
//
// A NOTE IS A STORY. Its body is an ordinary body — paragraphs, formatting, styles, the same
// operations — laid out at the foot of a page or at the end of the document rather than in the
// column. So `body` answers a `Body`, and everything the object model can do to the main story it
// can do to a note without a second vocabulary for it.
//
// `delete()` REMOVES THE REFERENCE TOO. A note's body in the notes part and the citation that
// reached it are one thing to a reader; deleting the body alone would leave a mark in the text
// pointing at nothing. The engine spells that as a package-level transaction, which is why it
// travels alone in its batch.
