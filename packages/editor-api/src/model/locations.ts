// TWO REASONS THIS IS ITS OWN FILE. The first is that "where does this text go" is one vocabulary
// shared by `Body`, `Paragraph` and `Range`, each accepting a different SUBSET of it — and a subset
// is only meaningful if the whole is written down once. The second is that these values arrive from
// a consumer, in a language with no runtime types: `insertText('x', 'Ende')` is a typo that a model
// which trusted its parameters would turn into a silent no-op or, worse, an insertion somewhere
// plausible. Every one of them is checked against the list and refused by name.
