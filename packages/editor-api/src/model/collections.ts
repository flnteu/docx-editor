// The paragraph and range collections: the two whose members are not simply handles.
//
// The rules every collection shares — how it addresses itself, what `items` means, how an edge
// accessor settles — live in `item-collection.ts`, which nothing in the model imports FROM. These
// two are here because they are the exceptions to the common shape: a range collection's members are
// spans rather than handles, and the pieces a `Paragraph#split` answers are filled by the split's own
// command rather than by a listing read.
