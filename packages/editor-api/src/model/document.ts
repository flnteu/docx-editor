// The document: the root everything else is reached from.

// It is deliberately thin. A document in this API is not a bag of content — it is the thing that has
// stories, and this slice publishes one of them (`body`) plus the main story's paragraphs as a
// convenience, because `document.paragraphs` is how source-compatible code walks a document.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE IS NOT HERE ON PURPOSE. `contentControls`, `comments` and `sections` are declared
// in the compatibility surface and are not implemented in this slice; a getter that answered an
// empty collection would be indistinguishable from a document that has none, which is exactly the
// kind of quiet wrong answer this lane is built to avoid. They arrive with the slices that can read
// them.

/**
 * The document: the root every other object is reached from.
 *
 * Deliberately thin. A document here is not a bag of content — it is the thing that HAS stories.
 * It publishes the main story as {@link Document.body}, plus that story's paragraphs directly as
 * `document.paragraphs`, because that is how source-compatible code walks a document.
 *
 * Reached once per {@link RequestContext} and memoized: `context.document` is the same object
 * every time, so a property loaded through one reference reads back through any other.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * await runtime.run(async (context) => {
 *   const paragraphs = context.document.paragraphs;
 *   paragraphs.load('items');
 *   await context.sync();
 *
 *   for (const paragraph of paragraphs.items) paragraph.load('text');
 *   await context.sync();
 *
 *   for (const paragraph of paragraphs.items) console.log(paragraph.text);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The first sync retrieves the collection's items. Once those items are available, the second
 * sync retrieves each paragraph's text.
 *
 * @public
