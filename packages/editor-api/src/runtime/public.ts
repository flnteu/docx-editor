// The vocabulary both entry points share.
//
// One list, re-exported by the neutral entry and by the browser entry, so the two cannot drift into
// offering different types for the same concepts.
//
// WHAT IS PUBLIC is the lifecycle and its vocabulary — the runtimes, the request context, tracked
// objects, the proxy and result base types, the load options, the error codes — and the object model
// a context hands out. The model classes are exported so a consumer can NAME them in their own
// signatures (`function summarize(body: Body)`); every constructor is private, because the only way
// to get one is to be given one. What is NOT public is how they are built: `model-support.ts`, the
// object paths and the action queues are this package's, so the shape of the model can change
// without changing what a consumer can hold.
