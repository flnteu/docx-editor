// The runtime against the declarations, and the generator against the runtime.
//
// Task 1 authored `compat/docxeditor/declarations.ts` by hand from the published Word API surface,
// deliberately without deriving it from any Microsoft package. This runtime has to be the thing
// those declarations describe — otherwise the compatibility story is two documents that happen to
// use the same words.
//
// Two halves are checked now. The lifecycle — `sync()`, a context on every proxy, `isNullObject`,
// and a `run` that returns the callback's value — and the object model's call shapes: every member
// `Document`, `Body`, `Range`, `Paragraph` and the collections implement, compared against the
// declared parameter tuples so a consumer's own call sites compile against either.
// `__conformance__/declared-lifecycle.ts` says exactly what is compared, what is compared only by
// argument list, and which declared members are still owed by the formatting and content-control
// slices.
//
// Type-level assertions only mean something if a compiler reads them, and `bun test` does not
// typecheck. So this compiles them — and compiles a deliberately wrong copy to prove the compiling
// is doing work.
