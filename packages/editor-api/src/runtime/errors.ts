// The runtime's own error vocabulary.
//
// DocxEditor owns every code here. Three of them — `PropertyNotLoaded`, `InvalidObjectPath`,
// `NotSupported` — carry the meanings a batching object model has to have if `load`/`sync` is
// to mean anything at all, and the compatibility contract names them; the rest are this
// runtime's, chosen to make each refusal distinguishable from every other.
//
// TWO RULES, both of which exist because an SDK error is a public API:
//
// STABLE CODES. `code` is the thing to branch on, and it never changes shape. A consumer that
// handles `PropertyNotLoaded` by loading and syncing again must keep working across versions,
// so codes are added rather than repurposed.
//
// NOTHING FROM THE ENGINE IN THE MESSAGE. The host answers refusals with its own codes and
// details — a store rejection reason, an opaque handle ref, an offset range. None of it is
// copied into a thrown error. A ref in a message is a name a consumer can start depending on,
// and a store's rejection reason is an implementation detail that would become a documented
// one the moment somebody matched on it. What a consumer gets instead is a stable code, a
// fixed sentence, and `target` — the consumer-facing path of the object or property involved,
// which is the only identifier they wrote themselves.
