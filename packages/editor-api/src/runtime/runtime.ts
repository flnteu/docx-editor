// The runtime: one host, many runs.
//
// A runtime owns a document host and hands out request contexts. It is deliberately thin — the
// interesting rules are the context's — and it makes exactly three decisions:
//
// ROOTS ARE RESOLVED ONCE. The handles for the document and its body are the entry every object
// model starts from, and they are stable for the life of a host, so they are fetched once and
// cached. Eagerly, at construction, so that inside a run NOTHING reaches the host until
// `sync()`. A host with no document right now — a browser editor between mounts — simply fails
// that attempt, and the next run tries again; that is why the cache is "resolve on demand and
// keep", not "resolve in the constructor or die".
//
// RUNS ARE ISOLATED, NOT SERIALIZED. Every `run` gets its own context with its own queue, so two
// runs cannot interleave into one batch, and a run started inside another run works instead of
// waiting for a lock its own caller holds. Serializing runs would deadlock exactly there — the
// outer run cannot finish until the inner one does, and the inner one cannot start until the
// outer finishes — and "do not deadlock" is a harder requirement than "one run at a time".
// Batches themselves are serial regardless: `host.execute` is synchronous, so two contexts'
// batches are ordered by the order their `sync()` calls happen, and each is atomic on its own.
//
// DISPOSAL IS FINAL. `dispose()` releases the host once and is safe to call again; every later
// `run` or `save` fails `RuntimeDisposed` rather than reaching a host that no longer has a
// document.
