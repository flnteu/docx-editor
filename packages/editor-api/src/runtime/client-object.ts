// The base every document proxy is.
//
// A proxy is three things and no more: the context it belongs to, the path that says whether it
// can be addressed, and the properties a completed `load` filled in. Everything a subclass adds
// is expressed through the four protected helpers below, which is what keeps one set of rules —
// when a call is refused, when a read is refused, what a released object does — from being
// re-decided per object in the model that follows.
//
// LOADED VALUES LIVE IN A MAP. Not on the instance, and not on a plain object used as a
// dictionary: property names reaching `load(...)` can come from a consumer's own data, and a
// name like `__proto__` assigned into an object is the prototype-pollution hazard the repository
// audits for. A `Map` has no such key, so the whole class of problem is absent rather than
// filtered.
//
// A RELEASED PROXY STILL ANSWERS WHAT IT ALREADY KNEW. Reading a property that was loaded before
// the run ended is served from the map, because that value is a copy the consumer already has —
// it is not a reach into a document. Anything that would talk to the document (`load`, a write,
// a method) refuses with `InvalidObjectPath`. The line is "does this need the document", not
// "does this look like a read".
