// The action queue: what a proxy call leaves behind instead of doing something.
//
// A queued action is a closure pair — how to say it to the host (`plan`), and what to do with
// the answer (`settle`) — plus the label an error may name. Keeping both halves on one object
// is what makes hydration positional rather than guessed: the answer at index i belongs to the
// action at index i, and there is no lookup table to get out of step with the request.
//
// `take()` is the important method. Dispatching a batch REMOVES its actions from the queue and
// nothing ever puts them back, including when the batch fails. A queue that re-queued a failed
// batch would replay writes the consumer had already been told about, at a revision they never
// saw; a queue that kept them would send them twice. So a failed sync loses its batch, says so
// with a typed error, and whatever is queued afterwards is a new batch that can succeed on its
// own.
