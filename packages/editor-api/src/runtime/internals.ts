// The seam between a request context and the proxies it owns.
//
// A proxy has to reach its context's queue, its host and its object registry; a context has to
// release and re-bind proxies. Neither of those is anything a consumer should be able to do, and
// both would be plainly public if they were ordinary methods on classes this package exports.
//
// So the seam is symbol-keyed. `INTERNALS`, `RELEASE` and `REBIND` are not exported from the
// package entry, which makes them unreachable from outside this package without deliberately
// importing a module the entry does not advertise — while remaining ordinary property access
// inside it, so the object model in later slices needs no privileged construction.
//
// This module imports nothing at runtime. It is the one place both sides of the seam can depend
// on without the context and the proxy base importing each other.
