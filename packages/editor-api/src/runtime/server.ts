// A runtime over DOCX bytes, with no browser anywhere.
//
// `async` even though opening a package is synchronous today. Opening a document is exactly the
// operation that acquires resources — and a caller who wrote `await` can be handed a runtime that
// streams, fetches or hands the work to a worker later, without their code changing. A
// synchronous signature would make that a breaking change.
//
// UNTRUSTED BYTES. A `.docx` is a zip of XML an attacker controls end to end, and every one of
// those defences lives in the core reader this calls: decompression-ratio and size caps, part and
// relationship path validation, DTD/entity-free XML. This module adds no parsing of its own, and
// a refusal comes back as `InvalidArgument` rather than as a throw from inside a zip decoder.
// Nothing about WHY the document was refused is put in the message: a caller opening files they
// did not author gets "not a document this API can open", and a probe cannot use the error to
// learn about the reader's limits.

 * than as a throw from inside a zip decoder, and says nothing about WHY — a caller opening files
 * they did not author gets "not a document this API can open", so a probe cannot use the error to
 * learn the reader's limits.
 *
 * The bounded parse is complete when this promise resolves. The runtime does not retain the
 * caller's `Uint8Array`, so the caller may reuse or transfer that input buffer afterward.
