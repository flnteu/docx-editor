// Translation both ways across the host protocol.
//
// Out: a queue of actions becomes one `AutomationBatchRequest` whose operations are in queue
// order. In: a response is either hydrated positionally into the actions that asked for it, or
// turned into exactly one typed error.
//
// The host's atomicity is the thing being preserved here. When a batch is refused it reports
// the failing operation and marks EVERY other operation `skipped` — including the ones before
// it — because nothing was published. This module therefore never hydrates a partial response:
// a refusal produces an error and no `settle` call at all, so a proxy can never end up holding
// a value from a batch the document did not accept.
