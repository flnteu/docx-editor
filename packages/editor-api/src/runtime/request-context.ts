// The context a `run` hands to its callback: one queue, one document, one sync at a time.
//
// `sync()` is the only thing in this runtime that talks to the document, and it does so exactly
// once per call: plan the queued actions in order, send ONE batch, hydrate the answers. That is
// where atomicity comes from — the host commits every command in a batch as one transaction, so
// a batch either happens whole or not at all, and the runtime never splits a consumer's `sync()`
// into several batches behind their back.
//
// CONDITIONAL WRITES. A context that has read from the document remembers the revision it read
// at, and a later batch that writes is sent conditional on that revision. This is what stops a
// decision made from a cached read being applied to a document that has since moved — the case
// the whole read-decide-write shape of a batching API invites. A context that has not read
// anything has nothing to be stale about, so its writes go out unconditionally, which is what an
// unconditional command wants. Adopting an object counts as having read: its loaded state came
// from some revision, and the run that writes from it is the one that has to be conditional.
//
// EACH CONTEXT IS ITS OWN. Two runs on one runtime never share a queue, so their actions cannot
// interleave into one batch however their awaits happen to schedule. See `runtime.ts` for why
// that isolation — rather than serializing runs — is the answer for nesting.
