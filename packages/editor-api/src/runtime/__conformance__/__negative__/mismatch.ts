// belong to LATER SLICES — members that are coming, not members that are not. What is no longer
// among them is `start`/`end`: a range does not report document-wide character offsets, this engine
// maintains no such coordinate space, and rather than leave a declaration the shipped object could
// never satisfy, they were de-selected from the manifest and removed from the declarations. If this
// ever compiles, either those later slices landed — in which case the assertion belongs next door —
// or the declarations were quietly widened to match what exists.
