/**
 * The same document automation, for a page that already has an editor open.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { DocxEditor } from '@docx-editor.dev/editor-api/browser';
 *
 * const runtime = DocxEditor.createBrowser(editor, { author: 'Demo Reviewer' });
 * await runtime.run(async (context) => { … });
 * ```
 *
 * A separate subpath rather than a second export from the package root, because `createBrowser`
 * reaches the editor lane, and the editor lane brings the painted engine and its font shaper with
 * it. Both namespaces expose `createServer`: opening bytes is neutral, and a page that opens an
 * attachment beside the document it is showing should not need two imports.
 *
 * The editor comes from wherever the host got it — `@docx-editor.dev/react`,
 * `@docx-editor.dev/vue`, or a plain page that created one directly. This package does not create
 * editors and does not own their lifetime.
