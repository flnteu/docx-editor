// The review surface's data, as a hook.
//
// THIS is the API. `DocxEditor.Review` and its parts are one rendering of what this returns,
// shipped in the box; nothing is reachable through them that is not reachable here. A host that
// wants its own markup, its own card layout, or avatars from its own directory takes the hook
// and renders whatever it likes — the same relationship `useFontFamily` has with the packaged
// font picker.
//
// Two things the hook must give you and you should not recompute. The ITEMS come from the
// document tree, not from what is currently painted: a queue derived from the page empties by
// half when the reader switches to a resolved view. And each item's Y comes from layout records
// rather than from measuring painted DOM, which would put the sidebar a repaint behind the
// document and break outright during pagination.
