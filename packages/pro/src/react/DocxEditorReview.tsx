// `DocxEditor.Review` — the review rail: every pending decision in the document, as cards
// beside the page it belongs to.
//
// One card per DECISION, not per site. A tracked row insertion is `w:trPr/w:ins` on the row
// plus a `w:cellIns` on every cell; a reviewer is being asked one question about it, so they
// get one card and one pair of buttons, and accepting resolves every site in one undo step.
//
// CUSTOMIZATION LADDER, the same five rungs `DocxEditorToolbar` and `DocxEditor.HyperLink`
// establish:
//
//   1. `className` / `data-*`      restyle the packaged parts with CSS
//   2. `icon`                      swap one part's glyph
//   3. `asChild`                   merge a part's wiring onto your own element
//   4. in-place part override      a `<Review.Accept>` child replaces that slot;
//                                  `hidden` removes it; `preset={false}` drops the defaults.
//                                  `<Review.List>` also takes a RENDER PROP, for a host that
//                                  keeps the rail and its positioning but not the card.
//   5. `useReview()`               the raw hook, for a surface with nothing in common with this
//
// Every string is an i18n key and every colour a `--doc-*` token, so nobody has to fork this
// to translate or theme it. Test ids are stable and unlocalized.
//
// POSITIONING. A card sits at its anchor's Y, which comes from LAYOUT RECORDS through the
// hook — never from measuring painted DOM, which is a repaint behind the document and breaks
// outright while pagination is in flight. Layout points become pixels through the engine's
// zoom, and the rail offsets by the painted surface's own position so it stays aligned when
// the host puts chrome above the pages.

 * Discard what the card holds: delete a comment thread, or reject a tracked change.

 * resolved but never removed — a reader who commented by mistake had to go back to the text and
 * delete the words to be rid of it. One control on both kinds, because "remove this" is the same
 * intent whichever the card holds; the engine's `deleteReviewItem` decides what it means.
 *
 * Absent, not disabled, on a card with nothing to discard — a custom node's, or a revision kind
 * the engine cannot resolve.
 *
 * Revealed on HOVER of the one thing it deletes, and on keyboard focus — the stylesheet owns
 * that, not this component. A rail of twenty cards each carrying a standing invitation to
 * delete somebody's remark reads as an invitation to click one by mistake; scoping it to the
 * node under the pointer also means a reply and the comment it answers never offer two
 * identical buttons at once, which is the state that makes a reader delete the wrong one.
 *
 * CSS rather than an `isActive` gate because a reply is never itself the active item, and
 * because requiring the reader to open a card before they can be rid of it is a step with
 * nothing behind it. `visibility`, not `opacity`: hidden must also mean unclickable, and the
 * space stays reserved so the row does not jump as the pointer crosses it.
