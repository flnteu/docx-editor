// How this package asks for the engine, which decides whether a page ends up with one of it.
//
// The engine carries module-level state: the HarfBuzz shaper and its cache budget, the grapheme
// boundary strategy, and layout caches keyed by object identity. Two copies in one tree do not
// crash. They load the shaper twice, read a boundary configured on the other copy, and miss every
// identity-keyed cache — wrong and expensive, quietly.
//
// This package registers modules into an editor the adapter constructs, so it has to reach the
// same engine the adapter did. A regular dependency lets a package manager nest it a second copy
// whenever the ranges diverge; a peer makes the manager resolve one, and say so at install when it
// cannot. The adapter is already a peer here for the same reason.
