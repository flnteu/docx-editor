// `defineCustomNode` — integrator-defined inline nodes anchored on run-level SDTs.
//
// This module is the RECOGNITION half of the contract: definitions, the module registration,
// and the pass that turns a document's inline SDTs into typed, recognized nodes. A node's
// identity rides in `w:tag`, which Word caps at 64 characters; anything larger is a PAYLOAD in
// a customXml data part the control binds to, resolved here and handed to the hooks already
// checked against the definition's `schema`.
//
// The write side is `insert-custom-node.ts` / `update-custom-node.ts`; a document opened without
// a matching definition renders its SDT content literally, which is also the free tier's and
// Word's fallback.
