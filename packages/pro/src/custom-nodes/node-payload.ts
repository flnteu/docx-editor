// Where a definition's payloads live, and what a payload has to satisfy to be written.
//
// Three decisions, in one place so the write path, the read path and the export path cannot
// each make them differently:
//
//   - WHICH STORE. One customXml store per namespace per document, so the namespace is what
//     decides whether two definitions share a store. Derived from `tagPrefix` unless a host
//     names its own, which means a host that never thinks about it still never collides with
//     another integrator's.
//   - WHICH ID. Minted from the store's own contents, so an id is unique within the document
//     that holds it and is stable for as long as the node is.
//   - WHETHER IT IS VALID. The definition's schema, applied on the way IN. A payload refused
//     here never reaches a file; a payload refused on the way out reaches one and comes back
//     broken.
