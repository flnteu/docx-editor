// What a custom node's payload is allowed to be, and the boundary that enforces it.
//
// A payload lives in a customXml data part, which means it arrives from a file the sender
// controls. The bytes say `{"depth":120}`; nothing says the sender did not write
// `{"depth":{"toString":…}}`, or 40 MB of nested arrays, or a `__proto__` key. So a definition
// declares its shape and this parses against it, at the read boundary, once — after which the
// host's `data` is the type it asked for and downstream code can stop apologising.
//
// WHY Standard Schema RATHER THAN A ZOD DEPENDENCY
//
// `StandardSchemaV1` is the interface zod implements (as do valibot and arktype), so a host
// passes an ordinary zod schema and it works:
//
//   const Iceberg = z.object({ depth: z.number(), charted: z.boolean() });
//   const parsed = parseCustomNodeData(Iceberg, node.data);
//   if (parsed.ok) render(parsed.value.depth);
//
//
// Depending on zod itself would put a copy of it in this tarball and a second one in the app,
// and two zods disagree about `instanceof` in exactly the way two engines disagree about
// caches. The interface is 30 lines and is meant to be vendored; this is that copy.

/**
 * The Standard Schema interface, vendored.
 *
 * Any zod, valibot or arktype schema satisfies it. See https://standardschema.dev.
 *
 * Reduced to the parts used here rather than copied: the spec's namespace, `Props`,
 * `SuccessResult`/`FailureResult`, `PathSegment` and `InferInput` are all absent. Assignability
 * with a real schema is what matters, and is checked against zod in the tests.
