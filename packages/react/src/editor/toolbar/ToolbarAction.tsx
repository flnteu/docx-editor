// A toolbar control for an action the CHROME REGISTRY does not describe.
//
// `ToolbarButton` is deliberately slot-bound: it takes a `ChromeSlotId` and derives its
// label, icon, command and enabled state from the registry, which is what keeps a toolbar
// button and its menu twin from describing the same capability two different ways. That is
// the right default and the wrong constraint for a host's OWN action — "Send for review",
// "Insert clause", "Attach to matter" — which has no slot and never will.
//
// Without this, such a host hand-wrote `<button className="docx-toolbar__button">` and
// re-derived our hover, active and disabled treatment from the stylesheet by reading it.
// That is a private class name doing public API's job: it pins the host to our CSS
// internals, and every one of them re-implements the caret guard (or forgets to, and the
// button steals the selection on mousedown). The menu already had `Menu.Row` for exactly
// this; the toolbar had nothing, and the asymmetry was the gap.
//
// It is NOT a way to fake a chrome slot. There is no `slot` prop and no engine wiring:
// enabled state, pressed state and the action are the host's to supply, because the engine
// has no opinion about an action it does not model. A control the ENGINE owns still belongs
// on a slot.
