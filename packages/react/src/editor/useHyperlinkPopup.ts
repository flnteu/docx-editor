// The hyperlink popover's behavior, UI-free.
//
// Everything `DocxEditor.HyperLink` does lives here, so a host that wants a completely
// different link UI takes this hook and ignores the parts — the same shape `useFontFamily`
// established for the font picker.
//
// The engine decides WHEN. A click on an external link and Ctrl/Cmd+K are gestures the
// surface classifies (a drag that merely ended on a link is not a click on it), so this hook
// registers with `setHyperlinkChrome` rather than binding listeners of its own. What it owns
// is the popover's own state: open or closed, reading or editing, and where it sits.
//
// The engine decides WHAT IS SAFE. `href` is always the sanitized projection, and the only
// path to opening one is `surface.navigation.openExternal` — the engine's single
// `window.open` gate. Nothing here builds a URL.
