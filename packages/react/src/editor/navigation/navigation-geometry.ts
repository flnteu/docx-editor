// THE RULE: an open pane must not move the page while there is room for it in the left
// gutter. A fixed "push the page over by the panel's width" is what makes a wide window
// feel like the editor jumped sideways for no reason — on a 1600px window with a Letter
// page there is already 500px of empty gutter, and the pane fits in it untouched.
//
// The page stack centres itself in the viewport (`.docx-editor-one-surface__pages` is
// `width: max-content` + `margin-inline: auto`), so a left padding P on the viewport does
// NOT move the page by P: it shrinks the centring box, and the page moves by P/2 — until
// the box gets narrower than the page, at which point the auto margins collapse to zero
// and the page sits at exactly P with the overflow scrolling. Both regimes are solved
// here, so the page lands exactly where the pane needs it and never further.
