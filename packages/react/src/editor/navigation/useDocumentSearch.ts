// The find half of the navigation pane, UI-free.
//
// Matches come from `Editor.findMatches()` — a read over the canonical tree, memoized per
// revision inside the session — and moving to one goes through `Editor.selectMatch()`,
// which selects the match AND reveals its page. Finding is a read and selecting is a
// write, and this hook keeps them that way: typing in the box never moves the caret.
//
// TYPING IS DEBOUNCED, RESULTS ARE NOT. The query lags the input by one debounce so a
// document-wide scan does not run per keystroke; once a scan has run its results are
// re-derived on every editor tick, so editing the document updates the list underneath
// the same query. That re-derivation is free when nothing changed: the session's memo
// hands back the SAME array reference for an unchanged revision, and this hook bails on
// reference equality rather than re-rendering the panel.
