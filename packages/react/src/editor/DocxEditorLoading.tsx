// The loading surface: what the host shows while there is no document to paint yet.
//
// Derives its answer from the SAME snapshot every other consumer reads, through
// `useEditorState`, so the loading screen and the chrome can never disagree about
// whether a document is ready. Renders nothing once loading ends — it is a conditional
// wrapper, not a container that stays in the tree.
//
// THE CONDITION IS `isLoading || isOpening`. `isLoading` is "no document handed over
// yet, and nothing went wrong" — NOT "nothing painted". That distinction is what makes
// `isLoading` safe to gate a `DocxEditor.Content` on: a definition keyed on painted pages
// would deadlock, since nothing paints until Content mounts and Content would never
// mount while the screen is up. It also means a host that unmounts its viewport does not
// get the loading screen back over a document that is still loaded.
//
// `isOpening` is the second half: a LARGE document mounts behind one painted frame (the
// engine yields so this very screen can paint before the blocking parse+layout), and
// `isOpening` holds for exactly that window. It is OVERLAY state — this part shows for
// it, but a host hand-gating its own mount point must key that on `isLoading` alone,
// because the scheduled mount needs the mount point to stay in the tree.
//
// `when` ORs in what the editor cannot see: the host's own async, the fetch of the DOCX
// bytes and of font faces. It is optional — the default already covers a `Root` mounted
// while its document is still on the way, which is the common shape.
//
// SELF-SUFFICIENT STYLING. The `--doc-*` tokens are defined on `.docx-editor`, and `Root`
// renders no DOM — so a part placed as a sibling of the Viewport would sit outside any
// token scope and paint an unresolved, contrast-free ring. This emits `docx-editor` itself,
// exactly as `DocxEditorViewport` does, so it looks right wherever it is composed.
