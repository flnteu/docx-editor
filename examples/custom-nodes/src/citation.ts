/**
 * One custom node, defined once and used everywhere.
 *
 * A custom node is an inline node type YOU define — here a legal citation. It is stored as a
 * Word content control (`w:sdt`) whose `w:tag` carries the identity, so Word opens the document,
 * shows the citation's text, and hands it back unchanged. Open the saved file in Word and the
 * citation is still there; open it here again and it is recognized from the same tag.
 *
 * `w:tag` caps at 64 characters, which is enough to say WHAT something is and never enough to
 * say what it holds. So the citation's own record — the pinpoint, the quoted passage — lives in
 * a PAYLOAD: a customXml data part the control binds to, written in the same transaction as the
 * control and handed back already checked against the schema below.
