// `preset={false}` opts out of the registry's default arrangement entirely, so the ORDER
// here is the order on screen. That is the heavier of the two customization paths — the
// lighter one is dropping a single part in and letting everything else stay — and it is
// the one worth showing, because it is what a product with an opinion about its own toolbar
// actually does.
//
// Every packaged part still drives its chrome slot: the enabled state, the pressed state
// and the command all still come from the engine. Only the glyph is the demo's.
