// The demo's own label overrides.
//
// Every packaged part takes a `t`, and `useChromeTranslate(ICE_LABELS)` builds the one a
// host passes: overrides first, then the active locale catalogue (bundled English by
// default). A host that renamed six things should not have to restate the other four
// hundred, and a key that falls through to its own name is a visible bug rather than a
// blank control — both of which the hook already guarantees, so this file is left holding
// only the theme's actual vocabulary.

/**
 * Just the labels the Igloo theme renames — ROWS and CONTROLS, never the menu bar itself.
 * Everything else falls through to the catalogue.
 *
 * A `Map`, not an object literal, because the key is CALLER input: an object answers
 * `constructor` and `toString` off the prototype chain, so `t('constructor')` would
 * return a function rather than a string. `useChromeTranslate` takes a `ReadonlyMap` for
 * exactly that reason; an example that teaches the API should teach that too.

    // buys the product nothing. Rows inside a menu are fair game (this file renames plenty),
    // because by then the user has already found the menu they wanted.

    // product's OWN menu was just a fifth invented word in a row of invented words; with the
    // four standing as File / Format / Insert / Help, `Custom Actions` is visibly the odd one
    // out, which is exactly what it is.
